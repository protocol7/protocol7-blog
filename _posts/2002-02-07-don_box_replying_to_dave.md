I agree with him, I think that maybe the biggest weakness with Javascript is its lack of typing. But <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/js/language/js20/libraries/types.html">Javascript 2.0</a> that problem is getting a solution. But of course, it will take 5+ years before we can use that for a wide browser audience.

    But for server side apps we already have <a href="http://webdeveloper.earthweb.com/webjs/article/0,,12721_944871,00.html">JScript.Net</a> which adds most of the new stuff in JS2.0 (types, classes, constants, packages and more). JS is going seriously powerful within the next couple of years.

  <p>
    Google Research has <a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/08/all-our-n-gram-are-belong-to-you.html">collected full six DVDs of words</a> from their internet index. That&#8217;s 1,011,582,453,213 unique words, with counts. Amazing material if you&#8217;re in to that stuff. I have no idea what to do with the data, but I&#8217;m thinking of ordering it just to play around with.

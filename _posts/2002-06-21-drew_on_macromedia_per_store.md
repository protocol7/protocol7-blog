    <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0104813/2002/06/20.html#a77">Drew on Macromedia Per Store</a>. Well, ASV will at the moment crash Mozilla/Netscape 7 if you view SVG content. But, for IE4+ you are certainly right that you could build this application, getting a much more accessiable and standards compliant solution. But, just like Drew notes, the lack of a good IDE would terrify any developer that is not a die-hard SVG fan.

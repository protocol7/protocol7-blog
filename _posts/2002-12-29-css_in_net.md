  <p>
    I used uploaded the last parts of the CSS support for SharpVectorGraphics. It&#8217;s based on a subclassed XmlDocument which adds support for looking up style rules from external stylesheets, style elements, user and useragent stylesheets. It supports the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#inheritance">cascade rules of CSS 2.1</a>, most of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/">selectors in CSS 3</a> and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/">majority of the CSS 2.1 DOM</a>. There are lots of things to improve but it got all the basics. No package yet so you have to get it from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/svgdomcsharp">CVS</a>. Hopefully there will be a package in a few days to play with. Feel free to <a href="mailto:niklas@protocol7.com">email me any feedback, bug reports or feature requests</a> :-)

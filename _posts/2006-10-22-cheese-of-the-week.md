    It&#8217;s now been a long time since I wrote about our cheese choices for the weekend. Here&#8217;s how it turned out this weekend.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Sainte-Maure de Touraine &#8211; a beatiful goats milk cheese with a heavy ash and mold rind. This is a new favorite which I&#8217;m sure will find its way back to our table.
    </li>
    <li>
      Taleggio &#8211; this is mostly for Eva, it&#8217;s one of her favorites, not that I don&#8217;t enjoy it :-)
    </li>
    <li>
      Chimay with beer &#8211; and this would be my preferred choice. Makes it to the table probably every other week.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    All of this was served with a bottle of Jean Leon Magnolia, a spanish white wine which just arrived at Systembolaget.

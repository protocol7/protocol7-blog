  <p>
    My all-time favorite HTML editor will no longer be developed. Instead it&#8217;s now an integral part of Dreamweaver MX, and it&#8217;s done in a pretty good way from what I&#8217;ve seen in the preview release.

    <a href="http://jdmx.blogspot.com">John Dowdell</a> got the news: &#8220;Some Homesite folks wanted Homesite to change and advance in some ways too, but this won&#8217;t happen, sorry. Dreamweaver MX is now the common path, incorporating elements from Dreamweaver 4.0, Dreamweaver UltraDev, Homesite, ColdFusion Studio, and JRun Studio.&#8221;

    <a href="http://fileforum.betanews.com/detail.php3?fid=947721727">WindowBlinds 3.1</a> was just released. I&#8217;m running it now. It&#8217;s way faster then older versions. I wonder if it&#8217;s the hardware acceleration that makes the difference. And what kind of hardware acceleration is it? Will I be bying a WindowBlind-AGP card soon? :-)

    Apples releases the beta for their new browser &#8211; <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/#">Safari</a>. There was much rumours on an Apple browser after David Hyatt left the Netscape and the Mozilla project to start working for Apple, but Safari is instead based on <a href="http://www.konqueror.org/">Konqueror</a>. This will probably be a critical blow to IE for Mac, which is just fine for me.

    Apple also <a href="http://lists.kde.org/?l=kfm-devel&#038;m=104197092318639&#038;w=2">confirmed to KDE</a> that they will be participating in the open-source project. They also posted the <a href="http://lists.kde.org/?l=kfm-devel&#038;m=104196912316326&#038;w=2">change log from KHTML to Safari.</a>

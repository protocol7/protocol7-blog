    Macromedia also released <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/desdev/mx/flashcom/">Flash Communication Server</a> today. With the server you can build real-time video sharing apps and lots more. Very cool stuff and it opens up a world of new kinds of applications that we haven&#8217;t seen on the net before. Now, if they only could switch to a open, accessiable format&#8230;

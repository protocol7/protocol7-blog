    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xframes/">XFrames working draft</a> released. Tries to fix the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xframes/#s_intro">current problems with frames</a>. The big new thing is that the URL for the frameset can contain URLs for all frames in the format:<br /> frameseturl.xfm#frames(frameid1=document.xhtml,frameid2=document2.xhtml)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This should solve most of the current problems with frames, but not all. For example, I would like a way to say, in a XHTML document, in what way it should be shown inside of a frameset (without having to do a script or metatag redirection).

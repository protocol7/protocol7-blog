    I&#8217;m a heavy user of the <a href="http://del.icio.us/help/firefox/extension">del.icio.us extension for Firefox</a>. One thing I really love is to open up the boomarks (click the checker button on the toolbar), enter a search string and find what I need.

    This weekend however, I had to prepare a presentation on IBM WebSphere Service Registry and Repository (great name, isn&#8217;t it).&nbsp;Since I was going to sit in the library, without any network access (that&#8217;s how I get boring work done) I needed all my bookmarked pages pre-loaded. So, I opened up the wsrr tag and right-clicked and choose &#8220;Open in tabs&#8221;. Lo and behold, not only did it open my bookmarks, it also closed my already existing 50-or-so tabs. Not so great.

    The del.icio.us developers take bug reports and feedback on a Yahoo Group so <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/delicious-firefox-extension/message/925">I posted my problem there</a>. And, a few days later I got <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/delicious-firefox-extension/message/933">this reply saying</a> that this actually happens due to a <a href="http://blog.codefront.net/2004/09/30/another-call-to-fix-open-in-tabs-in-firefox/">change in a Firefox update</a>. Workaround provided and tested to work as expected. While I certainly don&#8217;t agree with the default behavior, it&#8217;s at least nice that you can change it.

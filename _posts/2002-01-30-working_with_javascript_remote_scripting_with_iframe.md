    <a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/javascript/iframe.html">Remote Scripting with IFRAME</a>. A basic article on remote scripting. On XML-RPC: &#8220;down side is that it takes a bit more know-how and work to get it up and running&#8221;. That&#8217;s a failure of the libraries if that&#8217;s true, I don&#8217;t think it is.

    But he&#8217;s very much right that there is no support for XML-RPC in IE Mac (as far as I know). Who will be the first to fix that?

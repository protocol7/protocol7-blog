  <p>
    <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/releases/generics/">Java is getting support for generics.</a> As far as I can tell the syntax is exactly the same as in C#. That&#8217;s good. Lately I&#8217;ve been doing lots of both Java and C# development and would love to see generics added to both worlds.

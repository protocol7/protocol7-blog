    <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Dave</a> wrote yesterday about <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001161/2002/01/13.html">David Davies</a> who blogs from his mobile using Radio. So I wrote a 20 line script that allows me to do the same, but without Radio.

    My mobile phone operator converts my SMS to an email and sends it to an account that my script POP:s every second minute. Then it posts the blog text via the blogger API. Simple enough.

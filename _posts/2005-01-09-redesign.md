    I just did a redesign of protocol7, it just felt like it was time and that it was a way of getting started on the site again. I haven&#8217;t done much with the site for the last year of so and wanted to get going again. The <a href="http://svg.org/">svg.org content</a> and <a href="http://wiki.svg.org/">SVG-wiki</a> has now moved to a server hosted by Antoine Quint. Hopefully this will let me focus on the remaining parts of the site, particulary the blog.

    The design of the new site is based on the open-sourced <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/kubrick">Kubrick design</a> by Michael Heilemann and the <a href="http://www.josuesalazar.com/kubrick-on-mt/">Movable Type port</a> by Josue Salazar. Much thanks to Michael and Josue.

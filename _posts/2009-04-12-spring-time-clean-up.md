    Feeling it was that time of the year when you get the urge for a new site look. Of course, not that anyone actually visits sites anymore. But still. Seeing <a href="http://jonasboner.com/">Jonas Bonér site</a>, I wanted that theme so bad. Turns out it&#8217;s based on the default <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master">Jekyll</a> theme and Jonas was happy to let me steal the look. So, I&#8217;ve now adopted it as a WordPress theme. Right now, it&#8217;s pretty much a straight copy of Jonas look, but I wanted to have a baseline to start from. Over time, it will likely diverge somewhat from the current look. Also, I will publish the sources in the coming days on <a href="http://github.com/protocol7/">my GitHub page</a>.

    Update: I&#8217;ve now <a href="http://github.com/protocol7/wp-jekyll-theme/tree/master">published the theme</a> on my github. Since Jekyll is under a MIT license, I picked the same license for this theme.

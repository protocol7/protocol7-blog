    Andre Durand <a href="http://discuss.andredurand.com/stories/storyReader$276">write</a> about the future development of Jabber. He thinks better, fewer and more extensiable (from server side) clients are the way to go. I very much agree. I think this is crucial for Jabber to ever reach beyond the geeks. But sadly, most of the client developers don&#8217;t really understand this. We tried to with <a href="http://www.webjab.com">webjab</a> (now pretty much dead), and I think we got a bit on the way but much much more is needed.

    Then, the other way I see Jabber being used is as a hidden tool to send small XML messages across the web. This is where Jabber might be really important in todays distributed computer world.

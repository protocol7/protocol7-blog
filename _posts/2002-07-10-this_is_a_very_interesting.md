  <p>
    This is a very interesting <a href="http://www.snee.com/xml/xlink/sxlinkdemo.xml">demo of XLink support</a> in Mozilla. I find it important that Mozilla is experimenting with the &#8220;new&#8221; web standards (e.g. XLink, XForms, SVG) to set and example for other browsers. IE is no longer the most feature-rich browser.

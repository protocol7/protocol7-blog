    The work has begun on the standard that shouldn&#8217;t exist. The last couple of years work on XML has shown that a new revision is necessary. <a href="http://www.textuality.com/xml/xmlSW.html">Tim Bray and some others</a> has written a skinkworks document outlining their ideas for XML 2.0. They throw out DTD, entities and add namespaces, base and infoset.

    I think this a necessary step to take. XML makes no sense without namespaces so it should be better integrated. And DTDs and entities has past their best-before date.

    <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/02/20/deviant.html">xml.com</a> has a very interesting article about this as well.

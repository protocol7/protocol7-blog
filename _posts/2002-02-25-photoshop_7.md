    Adobe has finally <a href="http://www.macworld.com/2002/04/features/photoshop/">released</a> some stuff on Photoshop 7. The big news are Mac OSX support, the healing brush (automatically removes small scratches from the image), a file browser and a few changes to the web tools. Nothing really dramatic if your a PC user but they keep making minor steps towards perfection.

    But why not:<br /> SVG export (texts and paths as vector, the rest as bitmaps)<br /> SVG import<br /> Integration with non-Adobe programs (such as Homesite)

    <a href="http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=32531">Musikbyrån</a>, the outstanding music show on SVT are currently running a series where they profile some of the major music cities. This evenings program was all about the new second wave of french dance music (the first being Daft Punk, Cassius et al). They got some great stuff coming out of Paris right now. Of those featured, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/uffie">Uffie</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/surkin">Surkin</a> where those that gave me the hardest time to sit down. Uffie reminds me a lot like Lily Allen, just even more funky and outspoken.

    Surkin is<a href="http://www.debaser.nu/?id=1312"> playing at Debaser in Stockholm and Malmö</a> later in May, to bad I won&#8217;t be around any of those places at that time. If you&#8217;re into chopped up electro, make sure you get there.

Given that we&#8217;ve been feed that protocol independence and stuff like WS-MEX, ERPs and WS-Trust was really important, it&#8217;s interesting to see the big guys now thinking REST is the next big thing. Did we all of a sudden realize that all that cruft wasn&#8217;t all that crucial anyways?

    Tool vendors is getting into REST. I guess any support is a nod of approvement, but given the focus on code-first, remote invocation, ignore-the-network frameworks that rules the WS-* world, I keep my hopes low for the near future. Please convince me otherwise, in the meantime a <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/">good HTTP client</a>, <a href="http://www.xom.nu/">XOM</a> andÂ  <a href="http://www.restlet.org/">Restlets</a> will be sufficient.

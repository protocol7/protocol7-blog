    Hey, this is cool. <a href="http://gotdotnet.com/community/workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=cab253e8-cb4b-47c4-a9d9-6c42947b04a8">XInclude.NET</a> has built a XmlReader that automatically resolves include. I have one just like that that I wrote some months ago. But I&#8217;m sure this one is much better, and tested :-)

  <p>
    The news on <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/productinfo/features/">Flash MX </a>is out and it looks pretty damn impressive again. New features:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      better arranged IDE
    </li>
    <li>
      they seems to have made some work on the actionscript editor as well, that was needed.
    </li>
    <li>
      debugger with breakpoints
    </li>
    <li>
      embedded video
    </li>
    <li>
      the event handling is improved, this is probably the best of all the new features.
    </li>
    <li>
      setInterval()
    </li>
    <li>
      textfields and buttons are now finally objects
    </li>
    <li>
      shape drawing. John Dowell talked a little bit on this on the SVG developers list. Will make it possible to make Flash show SVG, at least Tiny or Basic.
    </li>
    <li>
      sound completion event
    </li>
    <li>
      can now load MP3 and jpegs from external sources
    </li>
    <li>
      Unicode support
    </li>
    <li>
      Anchors, makes the back and forward buttons in the browser usable in Flash
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    But, still the old binary file format&#8230; they don&#8217;t seem the get XML for real.

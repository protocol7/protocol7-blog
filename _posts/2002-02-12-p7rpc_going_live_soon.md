  <p>
    Since I love the idea of web services I would like to really get it started. And I don&#8217;t think that you as a developer should really have to care if you&#8217;re using SOAP or XMLRPC to do the communication. Therefore, the last couple of days I&#8217;ve been working on a library that basically does two things:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    1. Makes it very simple to create web services from your new or existing ASP functions. Just include a file and make two calls and you got a web services that will respond to both SOAP and XMLRPC calls. It will also automatically provide some basic documentation for your web service in the same way as .Net does.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    2. Make it just as easy calling any web service with SOAP or XMLRPC from your browser.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I will upload the code with documentation later today or tomorrow. This first version is a little bit limited (especially on the SOAP implementation and error handling) but can do the basic stuff.

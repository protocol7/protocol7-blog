  <p>
    Time for an update on this weekend&#8217;s cheese choice.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Some left over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valde%C3%B3n_cheese">Valdeon</a>, a Spanish blue cheese made from cow and goat&#8217;s milk. Still wrapped in chestnut leaves. Quite tasty and very smooth.
    </li>
    <li>
      A brie made from goat&#8217;s milk.
    </li>
    <li>
      A big piece of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taleggio_cheese">Taleggio</a>, this is Eva&#8217;s favorite.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itche_Bai">Itche Bai</a>, a French miced ewe and goat&#8217;s milk hard cheese. Excellent taste, lingers for a long time in the mouth after eaten. And we&#8217;re <a href="http://www.ragazze.se/2006/02/06/en-alldeles-vanlig-onsdagsmiddag/">not alone in enjoying it </a>(in Swedish).
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    For todays breakfast at <a href="http://www.nollerab.com/">N&ouml;ller</a> I went for a ciabatta with Taleggio and cloudberry jam. For me a surprising but very tasty combination.

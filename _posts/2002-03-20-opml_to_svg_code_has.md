    OPML to SVG code has sturred some interest. That&#8217;s cool. I think this is one way to really show the true power of SVG. Any SVG image (and even animation) can be generated from all kinds of datasources. That&#8217;s sexy.

    Currently I don&#8217;t see SVG as a opponent to Flash. But some might think it will be, that will be a huge religous war all over again. Lots and lots of people (and companies) have huge amount of value invested in Flash. But I actually even think Macromedia will finally switch to SVG. Not the full spec (a full vector graphics format is not at all what they are trying to do with Flash) but one of the profiles. Just wait and see.

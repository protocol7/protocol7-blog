    For a long time I&#8217;ve been unhappy with the URL scheme that MT comes with (and that I&#8217;ve used for protocol7). Lately there&#8217;s been a <a href="http://www.ashbykuhlman.net/blog/2003/07/27/2227">lot of discussion on URLs in the blogging world</a> so I decided that it was time for action.

    Since my site runs on IIS I couldn&#8217;t use <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/08/15/slugs">the mighty .htaccess tricks that Mark uses</a>. And I wasn&#8217;t too happy with using <a href="http://mar.anomy.net/entry/2003/06/22/17.15.00/">URLs with hh:mm:ss as Mar does</a>. So, I ended up with a combination of both. Most of the tricks are from Mar but the URL scheme is closer to Marks. Redirects from the old URLs are done using meta refresh. A few hours work and everything has been converted, MT is such a great and powerful tool.

    Dave has also <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/04/01#la1ae9c78efd7c51d5a320ca81b3507c9">read</a> the news.com article. Just two comments:<br /> 1. They do let the chief architecht of Flash respond, he&#8217;s a Flash user for sure :-)<br /> 2. I would claim that Macromedia is not really inventing with Flash any more. They sure did, but now I think they are mostly patching a broken solution. Let&#8217;s restart the revolution that Flash once were, and let&#8217;s do it right from the begining this time.

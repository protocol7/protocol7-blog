    Service oriented architecture has been notoriously hard for the industry to define. Everyone and there dog seems to have thier own opinion. In here I collect some of the attempts. If you have further references that I should add, feel free to add a comment.

      In Service-Oriented Architecture autonomous, loosely-coupled and coarse-grained services with well-defined interfaces provide business functionality and can be discovered and accessed through a supportive infrastructure. This allows internal and external system integration as well as the flexible reuse of application logic through the composition of services.

      In short, SOA is about loosely coupled systems, message based communication and business process orchestration. As an abstract architectural model, it acts as an indirection between the business and the technology model. Web Services are the preferred implementation technology for loosely coupled and inter-operable systems.

      Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a component model that inter-relates an application&#8217;s different functional units, called services, through well-defined interfaces and contracts between these services. The interface is defined in a neutral manner that should be independent of the hardware platform, the operating system, and the programming language in which the service is implemented. This allows services, built on a variety of such systems, to interact with each other in a uniform and universal manner.

      The policies, practices, frameworks that enable application functionality to be provided and consumed as sets of services published at a granularity relevant to the service consumer. Services can be invoked, published and discovered, and are abstracted away from the implementation using a single, standards-based form of interface.

      A service-oriented architecture is a framework for integrating business processes and supporting IT infrastructure as secure, standardized components (services) that can be reused and combined to address changing business priorities.

      A software architecture of services, policies, practices and frameworks in which components can be reused and repurposed rapidly in order to achieve shared and new functionality. It provides a uniform means to offer, discover, interact with and use capabilities to produce desired effects consistent with measurable preconditions and expectations.

      SOA is an architectural paradigm whose goal is to achieve loose coupling among interacting software applications. Applications invoke a series of discrete services in order to perform a certain task. A service is a unit of work done by a service provider to achieve desired end results for a service consumer.

      (Service-Oriented Architecture) Formerly called a &#8220;distributed objects&#8221; architecture, the SOA term was coined at the turn of the century as Web services were evolving. CORBA and DCOM are examples of earlier SOAs. See CORBA, DCOM and Web services.

      The SOA abstracts and exposes business functions as services that connect multiple business applications in homogeneous or heterogeneous environments.

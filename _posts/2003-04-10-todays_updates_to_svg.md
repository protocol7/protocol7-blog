  <p>
    Today was another pretty good day on the SVG# (our native .NET SVG implementation) project. I uploaded <a href="http://www.sharpvectors.org">our new site</a>, implemented inherited gradients, finished up the basic shapes module with support for dynamic updates, wrote some more tests and fixes two bugs.

    Tomorrow: patterns.

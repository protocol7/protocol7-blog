    <a href="http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/en/2002/07/20020702.html">Opera strikes accord with Macromedia</a>. Even if I don&#8217;t agree that Opera is &#8220;the most standards-compliant Web browser&#8221; or that Macromedia is &#8220;committed to open solutions that are built to fully support existing Web standards&#8221;, it&#8217;s nice that the other browsers are seriously starting to get some real support.

  <p>
    Simon St.Laurent has written a draft for IETF on a <a href="http://simonstl.com/ietf/draft-stlaurent-xpath-frag-00.html">The xpath1() scheme</a> for XPointer. I can&#8217;t understand why W3C haven&#8217;t published anything like this already. Anyways, it&#8217;s good stuff. I&#8217;ll look into making a .NET implementation of it as soon as I have released the CSS parser and DOM I&#8217;m working on at the moment.

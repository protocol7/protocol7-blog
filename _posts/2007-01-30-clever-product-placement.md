    At the Swedish Grammys currently running on TV, I saw one of the most clever uses of product placement I&#8217;ve seen. Mostly, these are very in your face and annoying, like a SonyEricson phone for remote controlling your car or all good guys use Macs, all evil PCs. At the Grammys, the nomination presentation graphics is the Alt+Tab interface in Vista, you know the one with stacked windows. No logo, the only thing besides the actual stacked effect that reveal the product are the title bar buttons (minimize, maximize and close), however they are quite nicely blended into the frame.

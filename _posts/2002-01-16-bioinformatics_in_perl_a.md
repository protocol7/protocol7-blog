  <p>
    <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/01/02/bioinf.html?page=1">Bioinformatics in Perl</a> &#8211; a very interesting (but a bit shallow) article for a person like me. I got a master in molecular biology (actually halfway done with my PhD) and is now working with software development. Some day I hope to be able to combine these two areas. I don&#8217;t think I will do it with Perl but the knowledge from the <a href="http://www.bioperl.org">Bioperl project</a> will for sure be a great use.

  <p>
    It looks like we will finally get <a href="http://jroller.com/page/scolebourne?entry=announcing_jsr_310_date_and">a decent API for working with dates and times in Java</a>. After the debacles with Date (1900-based years anyone?) and Calendar (just how complex can an API be?), <a href="http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/">Joda</a> has been a savior. Now, a <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310">new JSR</a> has been registred that aims to start with Joda to create a new, java.time API. Hopefully, the leads can fight to keep this one as simple and logical as possible and fight the <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310#1">spec-by-committee</a> plague.

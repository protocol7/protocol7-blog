    Yesterday we finally launched and announced <a href="http://www.svg.org">svg.org</a>, what we hope will be a good community site for all things SVG. Currently we&#8217;re still beta testing it and will add more features and time goes by.

    The wiki has moved and a bunch of people have their blogs there and in a few weeks there will be tutorials and more.

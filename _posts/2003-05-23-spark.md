  <p>
    <a href="http://www.schemasoft.org/">SPARK looks like another attempt at doing GUI widgets for SVG</a>. We really need a good library of re-usable widgets. I hope this project delivers where others have failed because it will be some time before we see RAX from SVG 1.2 in any widespread viewer.

    Nick Bradbury who is the creator of Homesite and the wonderful Topstyle is currently building a RSS reader, called <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/">FeedDemon</a>. The screenshots looks promising and judging from his previous work I think it&#8217;s safe to say that FeedDemon will be high-quality stuff. Can wait to try it out.

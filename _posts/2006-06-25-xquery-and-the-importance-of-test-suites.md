    The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/">XML Query</a> WG has <a href="http://www.stylusstudio.com/xmldev/200606/post40140.html">announced</a> what they belive is the completed release of the test suite for XQuery. All in all, it contains a whopping 14500 test cases. That&#8217;s what the WG think is necessary to fully test the complete specification, all 239 pages of it. I think it will be a crucial tool for ensuring combability between different XQuery implementations and might make XQuery skip the long period of incompability that most other specifications has to endure. I just wish that the SVG WG would make the same prioritizes, instead of trying to release yet another bloated spec long before the previous is <a href="http://eric.van-der-vlist.com/blog/2546_Too_many_SVG_profiles.item">even close to being proven</a> and successful.

    And, if 14500 test cases are required for XQuery compability, <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/21/WS-Research">how many will be</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Web_service_specifications">needed for WS-*</a>?

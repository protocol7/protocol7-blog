    <a href="http://www.wired.com/">Wired</a> redesigned in XHTML and CSS. They even got <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,55675,00.html">an article on the rationale behind it</a>.<br /> It&#8217;s cool to finally see the big sites doing what many developers have talked about for some time now. Way to go! Who will be next?<br /> [via <a href="http://www.scottandrew.com">Scott Andrew</a>]

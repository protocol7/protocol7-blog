    Today I added support for the SvgPatternElement in our DOM implementation in SVG#. Sometime during the weekend I hope to finish a paint server for patterns as well, meaning we will support it in the GDI+ renderer.

    Other things happening in the project right now is that Kevin is implementing the methods for caluclating path lengths and finding points along a path.

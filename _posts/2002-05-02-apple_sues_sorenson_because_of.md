    Apple <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/story/0,,t269-s2109473,00.html">sues</a> Sorenson because of Flash MX. Apple belives that the agreement between them and Sorenson grants them exclusive rights to the compression technology that Sorenson just sold to Macromedia. This is going to be interesting.

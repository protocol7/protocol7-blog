    My <a href="http://marten.gustafson.pp.se/blog">colleague M&aring;rten</a> just <a href="http://marten.gustafson.pp.se/blog/2006/03/23/soadoesnotnecessarilyequalsws/">replied</a> to Jimmy Nilssons <a href="http://www.jnsk.se/weblog/posts/SOA-Qs.htm">question regarding whether SOA == WS</a>. As M&aring;rten, I think that equation is not necessarily true, possibly not even desirable.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I view services as a well designed (from both a business and technical standpoint) interface to perform a function. This is not bound to a particular technology (such as WS-*).&nbsp; In fact, I think the whole WS-* mess in many cases is holding back the possibilities of building a working SOA due to its complexity. I&#8217;m certainly a part of the <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/18/WS-Oppo">Loyal WS-Opposition</a> and prefer to use the strengths of each protocol rather than adding a leaky layer on top. In my world, using HTTP (preferably REST like) and a MOM (like ActiveMQ or WebSphere MQ) will suffice for building a very strong and flexible backbone to enable SOA.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But, the hard part of building a SOA is not the technical details (that&#8217;s been solved for years), it&#8217;s finding a appropriate services based on the business requirements. The experience in this area is far less advanced.

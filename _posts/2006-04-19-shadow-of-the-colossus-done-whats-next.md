    This weekend I finished <a href="http://www.shadowofthecolossus.com/">Shadow of the Colossus</a>. A great, if somewhat short (maybe 8 hours playtime) game. The idea of throwing out all the usual enemies and only keeping the bosses holds up. And some of the bosses are pretty stunning.

    Now what? Playing GTA3-SA for some six months left a backlog, so I think that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m going to find the next game. Metal gear Solid 3 is looking tempting (been stuffed away under the TV for a few months).

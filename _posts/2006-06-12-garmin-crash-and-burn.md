  <p>
    Just tried to do an upgrade of my Garmin GPS (<a href="http://www.garmin.com/products/nuvi360/">Nuvi 360</a>) to the lastest firmware. Using the web updater available from the Garmin web site I went along. Everything went just fine up to that moment of &#8220;Now the GPS will restart and install the upgrade&#8221;. Only that it didn&#8217;t, instead it just sat there saying the helpful &#8220;System software missing&#8221;. Panic. Lets try running the upgrader again, can&#8217;t find device. Crap. Try calling friends with Garmin GPSes at random, no help (except for <a href="http://aixpi.com/">Stephan</a> offering me the lend his GPS for our holiday to Italy that starts tomorrow). Google, no help. Call Garmin tech support, get &#8220;Really long waitin g time right now, call again some other time&#8221;. Google again. Heureka, <a href="http://www.gpspassion.com/forumsen/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=52810">found this excellent thread</a>. Download some low-level, unofficial Garmin software. Recreating the firmware again. Horray, everything working as expected once again. Pweeh, vacation saved.

    Lessons learned:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Don&#8217;t do this kind of operation the night before you really need your stuff working.
    </li>
    <li>
      Allways trust Google, Google allways know
    </li>
  </ul>

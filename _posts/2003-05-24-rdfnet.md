    <a href="http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/05/21/RDFNet">Tim Bray wants to give away the domain rdf.net to the first person that actually creates a usable RDF application</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    He also presents a new way to describe RDF tripples in XML called RPV. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s all that much easier or more clear then RDF/XML. But that is probably because I actually like the namespace+element/attribute name syntax in RDF/XML.

    <ins>The discussion on how to serialize RDF into XML has continued. <a href="http://w3future.com/weblog/2003/05/24.xml#a232">Sjoerd Visscher</a> had some comments and <a href="http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/05/22/RDFagain">Tim Bray then responded</a>. All of this is very interesting!</ins>

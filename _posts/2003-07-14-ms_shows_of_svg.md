  <p>
    <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/donxml/posts/9979.aspx">Ken Levy from Microsoft apperently showed a prototype SVG viewer during XMLDevCon</a>. After some misunderstandings it now seems like MS is not going to release this viewer, but at least we now their interested in SVG. Now, how can we get them to support <a href="http://www.sharpvectors.org/">SVG#</a>? :-)

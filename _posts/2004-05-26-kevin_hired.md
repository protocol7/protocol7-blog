    Kevin, the best SVG developer around, has been <a href="http://www.kevlindev.com/blog/weblog.php">hired by Xamlon</a>. I did som minor work together with Kev on Xamlon and must say that they have a quite impressive product on their hands. The vector rendering engine that Kev has written is very well written and competent.

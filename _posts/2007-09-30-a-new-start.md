  <p>
    A week of vacation with the family turned out to be exactly what I needed. Now feeling very relaxed and even the kid has overslept the last couple of mornings.

  <p>
    Tomorrow I start my new job, at <a href="http://www.callista.se/enterprise/en/index.html">Callista</a>. Hopefully, at least that&#8217;s my reason, I will get to work in more diverse assignments than was possible at the very focused <a href="http://www.zystems.se">Zystems</a>. My almost five years at Zystems has been the most rewarding in my career, so I hope I get to continue working with them. Given the small IT community here in Sweden, that&#8217;s seems pretty likely.

    Anyways, of to new goals.

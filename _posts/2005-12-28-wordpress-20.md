    Just upgraded to <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">WordPress 2.0</a>. In total (removing 1.5 files, copying over the 2.0 files and the running the upgrade script) it took maybe 7 minutes. The theme and plugins all seem to work as expected. All data and configuration is just like before. That&#8217;s how simple an upgrade should be. Kudos to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/">WordPress team</a>!

    Now I gonna see how the new spam filter support is working. Reports seem to be optimistic.

  <p>
    Geronimo M5 is, after a much work, <a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.java.geronimo.devel/17175">getting ready for release</a>. The release passes the TCK testing and has <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&#038;pid=10220&#038;fixfor=12310168">tons of fixes since M4</a>, in fact, they are getting close to a 1.0.

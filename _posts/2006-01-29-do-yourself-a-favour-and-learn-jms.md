    <a href="http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t62690.html">This post on why many Java developers are ignorant of JMS</a> makes a lot of sense to me. &#8220;Getting&#8221; messaging sure was an eye-opener, or a <a href="http://susning.nu/Lidnersk_kn%E4pp">Lidnersk kn&auml;pp</a> as we would call it in swedish. So, do yourself a favour and make &#8220;understand messaging&#8221; your late new years resolution (you probably broke the other ones already). After you do, the number of issues your applications get due to network and scalability problems will diminish.

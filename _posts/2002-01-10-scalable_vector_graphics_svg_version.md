  <p>
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-SVG11-20020108/">Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) Version 1.1</a> &#8211; draft 2 was released today. In SVG 1.0, the most crucial thing missing is text wraping. In this draft W3C publish the first suggestion on this. Looks very good, more like XSL-FO then HTML.

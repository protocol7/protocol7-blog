    As widely reported, <a href="http://googledocs.blogspot.com/2007/09/and-now-we-present.html">Google today launched</a> their PowerPoint/Impress equivalent over at <a href="http://documents.google.com/">GDocs</a>. I&#8217;m a happy user of GDocs, so this is something I&#8217;m quite interested in. Not that I&#8217;m creating that many presentations, but when I do, this could be a useful tool.

    One thing, that I find odd that they don&#8217;t seem to have implemented, is a way of creating your own themes. Conventional wisdom seems to say that presentations should be heavily sprinkled with your company logos (although some that actually knows this stuff <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2007/05/the_source_of_a.html">seems to disagree</a>). Not being able to create your own theme would put a lot of users of. Of course, Google offers some pre-defined themes, much like the useless templates you will find on Powerpoint or Impress. And, if you import a PPT file, it will actually use the theme from the PPT as the theme in GDocs, however, there seems to be no way of editing or reusing it. Odd.

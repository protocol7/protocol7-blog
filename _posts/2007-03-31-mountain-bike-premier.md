    This Sunday was the my premier of this years mountain bike season. Spring has been early and strong this year so we spent an hour and a half at Änggården in bright sun and 16 Celsius. I&#8217;m still suffering the remains of a cold so I wasn&#8217;t feeling to well, but still it was very nice to get started.

    I&#8217;m hoping to be able to participate in two races this year, the first is <a href="http://www.morksuggejakten.com/">Mörksuggejakten</a>, 70 km of rumored beautiful terrain around Rättvik. The second is to significantly beat last years result on <a href="http://www.bockstensturen.nu/">Bockstensturen</a>, the 100 km race outside Varberg. To meet the latter goal, I need to spend more time practicing hill climbing as it&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.bockstensturen.nu/karta.asp">fairly hilly track</a>. I think I&#8217;m going to try some more light-weight tires this year. Could make a great difference.

    Well, the RSS publishing in Blogger Pro works good, but assumes that the link to a post is http://www.protocol7.com/#theblognumber. This is not the way I do it at protocol7.com so I&#8217;m keeping the old RSS script I have.

    But, the good news is that I made it a lot better (titles much more usable, links goes to post directly, HTML striped out). You find the RSS link on the top of the weblog.

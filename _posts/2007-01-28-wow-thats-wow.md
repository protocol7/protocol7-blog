  <blockquote>
    <p>
      &#8220;Unfortunately, Web Services, at least the WS-* style, are &#8220;Web&#8221; in name only. While WS-* enables tunneling over HTTP (used merely as an XML message transport), in almost every important aspect, WS-* violates (or at best ignores) the architectural principles of the Web&#8221;

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      &#8220;It is my position that the W3C should extricate itself from further direct work on SOAP, WDSL, or any other WS-* specifications and redirect its resources into evangelizing and standardizing identifiers, formats, and protocols that exemplify Web architectural principles. This includes educating enterprise application architects how to design &#8220;applications&#8221; that are &#8220;native&#8221; web applications.&#8221;

    While I certainly could not agree more, it is interesting to see that even the big-shots bow agree, in public. <a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/10/wos-ec-cfp.html">That W3C workshop</a> might turn out to be a defining moment in how the web and web services are regarded among the broad base of developers and architects. I sure did not think so when the talk about it started.

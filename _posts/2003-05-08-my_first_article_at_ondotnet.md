    <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2003/05/05/gdiplus.html">My first article on the System.Drawing namespace</a> has been published over at <a href="http://www.ondotnet.com/">ONDotnet</a>. The article is a gentle introduction to GDI+ and some basic System.Drawing classes. The idea is to help a newcomer to get his first drawing code up and running.

    I&#8217;m very interested in feeback on areas on drawing in .NET that you would like me to cover in future articles.

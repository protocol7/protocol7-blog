    <b>protocol7 spring edition</b> is here. A little cleaner, a little more clever and much better looking. Hope you like it. And, if you don&#8217;t you can find a style switcher (thanks to <a href="http://idontsmoke.co.uk">Paul</a>) in the lower right corner.

    It might be worth noting that the two different styles uses the exact same markup and only differ in what CSS stylesheet they use. That&#8217;s the power of CSS.

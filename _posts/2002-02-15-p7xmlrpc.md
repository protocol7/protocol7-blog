<div class='microid-1d6209417f88bfd3ea81ac1ed85ab169685c4336'>
  <p>
    Also added <a href="http://www.protocol7.com/default.asp?x=projdoc/p7_xmlrpc">p7.xmlrpc</a>. It does exactly the same thing as p7.soap but with XMLRPC. It&#8217;s more ready the p7.soap. Just like p7.soap it contains two files, on for client side JavaScript and one for server side ASP.

  <p>
    This Tuesday sees the first <a href="http://www.scandevconf.se/">Scandinavian Developers Conference</a> here in G&ouml;teborg. For a newcomer conference, the speakers and subjects they&#8217;ve been able to attract <a href="http://www.scandevconf.se/conference/detailed-program/">seems quite impressive</a>. I&#8217;ll be there talking on REST in general and <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=311">JAX-RS</a> in particular. It&#8217;s a new talk for me, so I&#8217;ve been busy preparing (surprised every time how long it takes to get some slides done) and hopefully it will turn out okay. If you&#8217;re there, please come by and say hi.

    <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0112098/">James Strachan</a> has <a href="http://www.almaer.com/blog/archives/000246.html">hacked up support for Spring in Geronimo</a>. When ready it will enable including a Spring deployment descriptor in your EAR and it will run in the application server. This is excellent news and a very cool feature while waiting for EJB3.

    And the same thing is <a href="http://www.codehaus.org/~jboynes/">happing</a> for Hibernate.

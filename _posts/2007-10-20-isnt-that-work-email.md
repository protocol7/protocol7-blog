    I&#8217;m using GMail for both my personal and my work email. That means I have to remember to choose the correct From address for different recipients. I usually don&#8217;t.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748">Greasemonkey</a> to the rescue. I searched <a href="http://userscripts.org/">userscripts</a> without finding anything that matched my needs, so I <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/13143">wrote one</a>. It quite simply asks you for your work email and a set of patterns to match for. For every email you then compose, it will search the To field for the patterns. And if one match, and your From address doesn&#8217;t, it will warn you. Works for me. For the patterns, I keep a list of the domain names for the clients and partners I work with.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now, this is my first Greasemonkey script so please be kind, but <a href="mailto:niklas@protocol7.com">report back</a> any troubles or improvements. Also, I&#8217;ve found that other scripts I&#8217;ve used for GMail as frequently broken due to Google updating the site, if this happens to this script I&#8217;ll be happy to keep it in shape if you remind me.

    Oh, I almost forgot this one. Corel released the final version of <a href="http://www.corel.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=Corel/Products/productInfo&#038;id=1042152819585">SmartGraphics Studio</a> and their <a href="http://www.corel.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=Corel/Products/productInfo&#038;id=1042152911529&#038;did=1042152819585">SVG viewer</a> yesterday. I&#8217;ve tried them both out during the beta, it&#8217;s interesting stuff. I really hope it will turn out successful for Corel, they sure deserve it.

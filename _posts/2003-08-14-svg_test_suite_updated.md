  <p>
    The SVG WG at W3C has updated the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Test/">SVG test suite</a>. The former had some issues with some tests having errors. No change log but hopefully are the tests working better now.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    They also updated the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Test/20030813/status/matrix.html">implementation status</a>. ASV6 is well on it&#8217;s way to all-green. Let&#8217;s hope they can nail the last ones.

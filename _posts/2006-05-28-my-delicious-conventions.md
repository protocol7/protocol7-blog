    I spent some time this weekend cleaning up <a href="http://del.icio.us/protocol7">my del.icio.us bookmarks</a>. I have a decent, but not huge collection (616 links) and I find that every few months it&#8217;s a good thing to clean up duplicate tags (relax_ng vs relaxng), improve bundles and fix some misspelled tags. This time I also rearranged some of my tagging conventions. As most users, I add as many tags as makes sense for a certain link. I find the suggestions made by del.icio.us to be quite good and frequently choose among them.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Articles or blog posts I now tag with the author with the &#8220;by:&#8221; tag prefix, e.g. <a href="http://del.icio.us/protocol7/by:elliotte_rusty_harold">by:elliotte_rusty_harold</a>. I find this a good way of keeping track of writing by my favorite authors.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I use the <a href="http://del.icio.us/help/for">natively supported &#8220;for:&#8221; prefix</a> to send <a href="http://del.icio.us/protocol7/for:deeva">links to friends who also use del.icio.us</a>. I still got to gather some more experience on this but so far it looks good. I like to minimal approach del.icio.us takes to this type of functionality.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Links which are not HTML pages, especially PDFs, gets tagged with a &#8220;format:&#8221; prefix, e.g. <a href="http://del.icio.us/protocol7/format:pdf">format:pdf</a>. This serves mostly as a hint/warning for myself while browsing my links. As linking to special formats like SVG might increase, this might be a good way of locating all of these at the same time.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Links which require some attention from me, gets a &#8220;to:&#8221; prefix. Currently, there are two of these, <a href="http://del.icio.us/protocol7/to:read">to:read</a> and <a href="http://del.icio.us/protocol7/to:wish">to:wish</a>, but I expect further types in the future, e.g. to:blog for stuff I want to comment in my blog.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Since I spend a lot of time with different open source tools, lots of my links are for different OSS projects. As licenses are of great importance in this world, I&#8217;ve created a &#8220;license:&#8221; prefix, e.g. <a href="http://del.icio.us/protocol7/license:gpl">license:gpl</a>. I haven&#8217;t really started using this yet (only one link) but I hope it will be useful.
  </p>

    As seen above, I use different prefixes for special types of tags. So far I find it a very good practice and I expect to define further prefixes as I go along. A <i>de facto</i> convention for these types of tags would be great. For example, if everyone would be using the by: prefix, finding all articles by an author, spread over different sites, would be very simple. Does anyone know of such a conventions that people use (it seems like some of the prefixes I use also get&#8217;s used by others, e.g. <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/license:gpl">license:gpl</a>)? I would certainly be happy to switch to whatever is the majority choice. If not, how would one establish such a convention in the best way?

  <p>
    Looks like <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/11/qcon-london">QCon London this March has been announced</a>. Quite a few of the tracks look similar to the much hyped QCon San Fransisco a few weeks back.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Since almost the entire company is going to the conference, I hoping for the best possible content. From the track summaries, you&#8217;ll be likely to find me in the tracks covering <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/london/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=82">Architectures You&#8217;ve Always Wondered About</a>, <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/london/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=95">The Cloud as the New Middleware Platform</a> (finally getting to see one of my favorites, Gregory Hohpe) and <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/london/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=87">SOA, REST and the Web</a> (will be interesting to see if <a href="http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/">Stefan</a> can top the SF line-up).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So far, the list of speakers is quite short, but I guess most of the usual suspects will be coming.

    Expect me to blog as much as I can from the conference. See you there!

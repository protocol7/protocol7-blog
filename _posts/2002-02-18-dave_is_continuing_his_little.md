    <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/02/17#hurdlesCssMustOvercome">Dave</a> is continuing his little personal war against CSS. This might turn out to be a long story&#8230; to comment on his hurdles:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    1. Agree, but this is not a major problem I think. What&#8217;s important is to get a big sites that really matter to change their structure. The smaller, already crappy, sites I don&#8217;t really care that much about.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    2. I think this is the best point made by Dave. ALA, or some other people should really do this. It will be a really Good Thing for CSS.
  </p>

    3. Of course, the browsers <b>should</b> support tables. That&#8217;s not the issue here.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    4. That&#8217;s not either HTML nor CSS. That&#8217;s maybe SVG your talking about Dave. And that&#8217;s a very different story. And in Mozilla you can already do that, mix SVG and XHTML in the same document.
  </p>

    5. Limited browser support and knowledge among blog-developers should not be blamed on CSS.

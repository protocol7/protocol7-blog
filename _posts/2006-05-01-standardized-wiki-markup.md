    Migrating from one wiki software to another is a pain. A few years back I migrated the <a href="http://wiki.svg.org/Main_Page">SVG wiki</a> from <a href="http://openwiki.com/">OpenWiki</a> to <a href="http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net/">PhpWiki</a> (and since then it&#8217;s been migrated again, to <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a>). This was, a lot of really boring copy-paste work. Then again, a year ago I migrated our internal wiki at work from <a href="http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/">MoinMoin</a> to <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/wiki/?clicked=footer">Confluence</a>. Again, boring, tedious work. All of this because different implementations can&#8217;t agree on the basic syntax for marking up stuff like headers, tables and bold text. Common, how hard can it be. There are already <a href="http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/">some</a> <a href="http://www.xmlmind.com/aptconvert.html">attempts</a> for a common markup out there. Can&#8217;t you just agree on one?

    I agree with <a href="http://www.alittlemadness.com/?p=6">Jason Sankey</a> that standardizing on one-shall-rule-them-all wiki syntax would be great, can it be done? In the meantime, maybe one should write an any-to-any wiki syntax converter. By using a common syntax/object model one could easily plug in additional syntaxes as they (undoubtably) come along. Anyone know of such a project already?

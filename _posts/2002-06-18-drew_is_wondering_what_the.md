    <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0104813/2002/06/17.html#a62">Drew</a> is wondering what the SVG.NET Viewer is, and he&#8217;s right. The aim is to use the SharpVectorGraphics project (creating the SVG DOM in C#) to produce a SVG viewer written in C#. It will also come with a GDI+ renderer. The first major goal is to produce a static renderer and then hopefully hock up JScript to it to add interactivity.

    <a href="http://www.jabber.org/press/2003-09-22.php" title="JSF :: Press Releases :: 2003-09-22">Well, at least according to JSF</a>. I&#8217;m not so sure, 6 million users of ICQ sounds like a really low number. Anyways, Jabber is a way better technology compared to ICQ so I hope it&#8217;s true and that Jabber will containue growing.

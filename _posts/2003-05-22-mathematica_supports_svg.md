  <p>
    <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/products/webmathematica/newfeatures.html">The new version of webMathematica now supports SVG and MathML output</a>. It sure looks like SVG is making progress at being <strong>the</strong> vector graphics format. However, in the interactive vector graphics market Flash is still way ahead in terms of usage and number of developers. Slowly that might hopefully change.

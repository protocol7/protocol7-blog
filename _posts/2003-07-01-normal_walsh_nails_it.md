      &#8220;But I am astonished by the debate over escaped HTML. Most of the phrases that spring immediately to mind when I consider this debate are unprintable. At least, I&#8217;m not going to print them. Not in public. Here&#8217;s a sanitized summary: &#8216;are you freaking nuts?'&#8221;

    I agree with everything he says. We now have XML, why do we want to build tagsoup support into brand new specs. XHTML is an excellent format and there is <a href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/">absolutely brilliant applications</a> for automatically converting your legacy content to wellformed and valid XHTML. Can we please move on.

    Me and Eva is getting married in two weeks, so we&#8217;re getting pretty excited and nervous now. The actuall wedding will take place in this <a href="http://m1.317.telia.com/~u31712055/kungalv/images/KiGbg10.jpg">church</a> here in Goteborg and then we&#8217;ll have the party in this <a href="http://www.hd.chalmers.se/~d97ahjo/Bilder/Andra%20bilder/Skansen%20kronan/pages/IMG_0027.htm">old fortress</a>. Gonna be pretty cool :-)

    Wish us luck, it&#8217;s getting close!

  <p>
    Just had to try out the new blog feature in Word 2007. So far it looks good, although I&#8217;m still really confused about the new menu interface. Couldn&#8217;t even find the Open menu option until after clicking on all menu options at least twice I realized that the little circle in the upper left was slowly blinking.

    Now for <em>some <strong>HTML</strong><br /> <span style="text-decoration:underline">torture</span></em>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Update: the simple HTML test above didn&#8217;t turn as perfect as one could wish for. A <br /> tag was inserted before &#8220;torture&#8221;, but that seems to be a bug in WordPress rather than Word. Besides that, Word seems to create the &#8220;correct&#8221; tags, such as <strong> rather than <b>.

    The <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/onlineTraining/new2java/javamap/intro.html">Java Technology Concept Map</a> is a overview of most of the &#8220;official&#8221; Java technologies. Quite a nice picture of what we got and how it&#8217;s all connected. I wonder if it will be possible to get as a huge printout for the office wall without having to glue up the 18 papers it would take me to print it myself?

    Don Box on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/default.asp?pull=/library/en-us/dngxa/html/understandgxa.asp">GXA</a>, Microsofts Global XML Architecture. He basically lists some web service technolgies that Microsoft will support, e.g. WS-Security, WS-Referral. No real surprises, but he also writes in his <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/spoutlet.aspx">blog</a> that there are lots of things he can say at the moment.

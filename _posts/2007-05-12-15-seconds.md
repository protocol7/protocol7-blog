    On Thursday I was interviewed by a journalist from the Swedish computer magazine <a href="http://computersweden.idg.se/">Computer Sweden</a>. The topic was how it has worked out to take paternity leave as a dad in the IT industry. I was probably a pretty dull subject since I&#8217;ve only experienced the positive sides of staying home.

    Today I meet up with a <a href="http://www.stefanideberg.se">photographer</a> who took some shoots of me and Albin. Hopefully he&#8217;ll choose one with Albin in focus and me as a blur somewhere in the background. I&#8217;m no good on getting this kind of attention.

    Update: rumour has it that the article was in the paper today. I haven&#8217;t seen it so I have no clue as to how stupid I look in the picture or how cute Albin is. Can&#8217;t seem to find it online and I&#8217;m not a subscriber.

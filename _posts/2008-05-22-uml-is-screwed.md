    <a href="http://littletutorials.com/2008/05/15/13-reasons-for-umls-descent-into-darkness/">This is a perfect summary of why UML is screwed</a>. In fact, I would add in three more points to the list:

  <ul>
    <li>
      UML has failed to make sense in agile development. Agile developers prefer code over formalism and coding is very much part of the thinking process. Doing a major modeling exercise does fit well into this
    </li>
    <li>
      Open source developers don&#8217;t use UML. Again, open source developers communicate using code (I read tons of commit logs each day): The very nature of heterogeneous communities means you can&#8217;t force tools on them, and since the availability of good, free tools and interoperability between them is severely lacking, UML just doesn&#8217;t work beyond simple diagrams. And since open source is more important than ever, this is significant
    </li>
    <li>
      The support for advanced refactoring in modern IDEs means we keep changing our code all the time. Keeping a model up-to-date gets impossible very quickly
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    All in all, UML is screwed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Like many of the commentators on the post above, I use simple class diagrams and sequence diagrams to communicate. Usually as part of white board sessions. Despite many attempts, I now never use the UML meta model. The formalism in UML doesn&#8217;t help or interest me.

    On a separate note, number 12 on the list in the original post is &#8220;Treat software development like manufacturing&#8221;. This might be my favorite fallacy of software development management. But that&#8217;s for a different post.

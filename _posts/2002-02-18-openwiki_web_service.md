  <p>
    Uploaded a new <a href="http://www.protocol7.com/services/openwiki.asp">web service</a> today. It&#8217;s a API for the SVG-wiki<a href="http://www.protocol7.com/svg-wiki"></a>. The methods are the same as in the JSPWiki<a href="http://www.ecyrd.com/JSPWiki/Wiki.jsp?page=WikiRPCInterface"></a> but I return the data as UTF8 instead of making a base64 encoding of the UTF8 data. That breaks the XMLRPC spec but I think it&#8217;s a huge bug in the spec and will not follow it. Sorry.

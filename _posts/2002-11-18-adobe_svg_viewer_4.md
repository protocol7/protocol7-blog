    The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Test/20021115/matrix.html">SVG 1.1 implementation status page</a> has an interesting little note: &#8221; Note: interact-cursor-01-f was tested with Adobe ASV4 (unreleased), not ASV3&#8243;. I think that&#8217;s the first sign that Adobe is actually activly working on ASV4. Nice!

    Also, cool to see that Nokia go an almost full SVG Tiny implementation. I wonder when we got that in our phones.

    It&#8217;s interesting to see so many SVG implementations already. Lots of companies backing SVG. Now, let&#8217;s see who nails all tests first. My bet is on Batik but you never know.

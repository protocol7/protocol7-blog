  <p>
    <a href="http://webkit.opendarwin.org/projects/svg/index.html">Safari is begining their SVG implementation</a> and they aim for mixed namespace support just like Gecko. I don&#8217;t care much for the entire build-a-full-application-in-SVG but rather want a good vector graphics language in browsers. But, now that SVG seems to have become a competitive advantage for the browser makers I truely hope that we at least can get SVG Basic mixed with XHTML support in all modern browsers (except IE of course).

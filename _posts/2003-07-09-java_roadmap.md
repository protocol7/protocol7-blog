    Sun has published a summary of the <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/RoadMaps/J2SE_1.5/j2se_1_5.html" title="A Roadmap for Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) 1.4.2 and 1.5">roadmap for J2SE 1.4.2 and 1.5</a>. Nothing really new but still a nice summary of what to expect in the coming year.

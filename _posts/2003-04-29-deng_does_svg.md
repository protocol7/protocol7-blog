  <p>
    DENG, the XML/CSS rendering ening built in Flash, can now render <a href="http://claus.packts.net/w3blog/index.php?id=57">some simple SVG samples</a>. Pretty exciting what you can do with XML as soon as you got the basics (like CSS) working. I hope they continue of the renderer and see how far they can take it.

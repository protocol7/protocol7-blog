    <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,2001320013-2001353016,00.html">The Times</a> &#8211; &#8220;The FBI now says that 13 of the 19 hijackers probably did not know they were on a suicide mission. The 13 younger seem to have left no notes to their families, unlike the six pilots. FBI investigators also find it hard to believe that one of the 19 would not have broken ranks in a whole year of focusing on approaching death.&#8221;

    The <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/realworldsoa/archives/2008/02/ibm_agrees_with.html">quote on lacking SOA talents making SOA fail</a> has been going around the last couple of days. <a href="http://http://bitworking.org/news/293/The-Technology-Rejection-Curve">Joe Gregorio finally nails it</a>:<br /> 
    
    <blockquote>
      There just has to be a reason for the failure, and it couldn&#8217;t possibly be the technology. This is what I call the &#8220;Scooby-Doo&#8221; phase of the technology rejection curve, where the rubber mask has been ripped off and the crook yells as he&#8217;s dragged off by the cops:</p>

        And I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren&#8217;t for those meddling kids.

  <p>
    SVG just got a new viewer: BitFlash (one of the authors of the SVG spec) just <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/svg-developers/message/18970">released a alpha-version</a> of their <a href="http://www.BitFlash-Activated.com">SVG-tiny viewer</a>. Looks good! Can&#8217;t wait to see this in mobile devices, to bad I don&#8217;t have a PocketPC.

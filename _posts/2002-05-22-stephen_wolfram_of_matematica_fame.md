    Stephen Wolfram, of Matematica fame, is about to release his much anticipated book, entitled <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.06/wolfram_pr.html"><i>A New Kind of Science</i></a>. He tries to prove that most research could simply be replaced by matematical modelling. Might be an interesting read, he&#8217;s a fascinating personality.

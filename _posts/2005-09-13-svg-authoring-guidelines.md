    Jonathan Watt has written up some <a href="http://jwatt.org/svg/authoring/">authoring guidelines for SVG</a>. All SVG authors should read and obey these rules.

    I hope someone gets around to writing a SVG validator that besides doing the regular validation also warns for common interoperability problems. Possibly based on <a href="http://badame.vse.cz/validator/">Relaxed</a> (Relax-NG + Schematron). Such a tool would greatly help authors to write SVG files that works in all viewers.

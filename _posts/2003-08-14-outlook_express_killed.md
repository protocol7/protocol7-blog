    <a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/newstech/ebusiness/story/0,2000048590,20277192,00.htm">MS has confirmed that they will release no further versions of Outlook Express</a> [<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0117167/2003/08/13.html#a425">via Early and Adopter</a>]. The free products from MS seems to be killed one after the other. How long would you bet on for Messenger?

    I haven&#8217;t blogged anything on the progress of the .NET-based SVG viewer for a while. So, I guess it&#8217;s teaser time :-)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here are some screens of the latest build showing some of the new stuff: 
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.protocol7.com/svg.net/screens/text.gif">text support</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.protocol7.com/svg.net/screens/extTRef.gif">&#8230;with external references</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.protocol7.com/svg.net/screens/gradient.gif">gradients</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      Lots of the basic stuff has been added as well, e.g. bounding box calculation, xml:base support and much more. And, of course, lots of bug fixes.

  <p>
    Tipic has <a href="http://www.tipic.com/blog/tw32js%40tipic.com/1.1 - beta test">announced</a> a public beta test of their Windows Jabber server. I&#8217;ve tried it a little bit already and it&#8217;s looking pretty cool. From their docs it will be extensiable via COM which is way cool. This will be a major break for Jabber.

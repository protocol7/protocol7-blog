  <p>
    Lazyweb wish: I&#8217;m hosting a bunch of blogs on my installation of MT (>10, might soon be >50). Most of these share the same templates, so, when I change something in one of the templates I want to rebuild all blogs. Instead of doing this one-by-one I would like a simple &#8220;Rebuild all blogs&#8221;. Anyone got this already or has a good idea to where to start building it?

    Thanks for helping out!

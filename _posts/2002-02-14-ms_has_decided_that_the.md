    MS has <a href="http://discuss.develop.com/archives/wa.exe?A2=ind0202b&L=dotnet&F=&S=&P=79795">decided</a> that the won&#8217;t trust .exe applications running in the browser sandbox in .Net. This is the same way as Java applets has been working for many years. While it&#8217;s good from a security point of view, it&#8217;s a huge disadvantge for people like me who where longing for a good (java applets are not good enough) way to automatically run apps (plugins) in users browsers&#8230;

    Sometimes its amazing how slowly development can work. <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=223132">This bug</a>, the lack of scrollbars for the headers panel in Thunderbird, has been open for more than three years. The fix, based on the comments, seems to be a CSS addition of less than 10 lines. The bug has 72 votes and 112 comments which should make it a fairly popular bug. Still, it&#8217;s not fixed in Thunderbird 2.0 beta 1.

    Luckily, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/1003/">there is a great extension</a> that does fix the problem, and with some hacking of install.rdf it seems to work in 2.0 beta 1 as well.

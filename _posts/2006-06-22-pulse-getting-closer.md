    A few weeks ago <a href="http://www.protocol7.com/archives/2006/05/29/got-pulse/">I blogged</a> about the newest build server in town, <a href="http://zutubi.com/products/pulse/">Pulse</a>. All in all it looked very promising for matching our requirements for work. Two major things was missing, <a href="http://jira.zutubi.com/browse/CIB-412">dependent builds</a> and <a href="http://jira.zutubi.com/browse/CIB-352">LDAP authentication</a>. Now both seems to be implemented, I just have to wait for 1.1 being released :-)

    As usual, <a href="http://www.itworld.com/Tech/2987/nls_ebizmediators050429/index.html">Sean McGrath nails it</a>. His hypothesis is that EAI integration is all about dispute resolution. As someone working every day with EAI integration (more on that soon) I couldn&#8217;t agree more. We spend all our time mediating systems as well as people. The people building applications are just as different as applications themselves. This means being in a room with 60 year old guys who knows Cobol/RPG/APL inside out as well as the 25 year olds who loves .NET/J2EE. And to get them and their applications talking to each other. The methods for getting an application to exchange data has varied greatly during the last 25 years and we need to handle them all.

    It&#8217;s a very interesting and challenging job (btw, if your interested and based in Sweden, <a href="mailto:niklas@protocol7.com">contact me</a>).

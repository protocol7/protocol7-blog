  <p>
    I just uploaded a new <a href="http://www.protocol7.com/default.asp?x=projdoc/p7_getMSXMLVersion">script</a> that will detect what version of MSXML a client has installed. It&#8217;s a more powerful and smaller version of the script you can find <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/02/02/web/web0202.asp">here</a>.

  <p>
    I&#8217;m looking for a Relax NG editor, much like the XMLSpy visual editor for XSD schemas, that I can recommend for people that are not schema nerds. I know that Oxygen has a color coded editor with code completion but that&#8217;s not really what I&#8217;m looking for. Anyone got a recommendation?

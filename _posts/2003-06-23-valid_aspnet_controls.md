    The moaning on the crappy (X)HTML that the ASP.NET controls spit out is finally getting <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0603b.shtml#dotnyet">some</a> <a href="http://www.splorp.com/blog/archive/2003_06_01_archive.html#105604957243094752">much needed</a> <a href="http://www.asp.net/Forums/ShowPost.aspx?tabindex=1&#038;PostID=34126">attention</a>.

    I wouldn&#8217;t hold my breath waiting for Microsoft to ship better workin controls, they got a lously record when it comes to producing anything that conforms to (X)HTML. Let&#8217;s start a open source project that aims to deliver this instead. I&#8217;m in, any others?

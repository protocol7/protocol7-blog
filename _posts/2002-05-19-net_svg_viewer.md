  <p>
    Last night I started to play around with creating a SVG viewer as a .Net WinForms control. A few hours later it supported most of the path commands, a few basic shapes, stroke and fill. This is the first screenshot from it:<br /> <a href="blogs/svgviewer_screen1.gif"><img src="/blogs/svgviewer_screen1_thumb.gif" border="0" /></a><br /> More and more support for the spec will come, when the Sharp Vector Graphics projects get&#8217;s going (if ever&#8230;) the viewer might also get support for dynamic stuff (animation, scripting).

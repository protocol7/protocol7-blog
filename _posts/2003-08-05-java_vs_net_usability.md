      Please pardon me for saying this, but most Java apps look shabby compared with other desktop apps. Java now has a reputation for shabby-looking apps on the client-side. Swing was supposed to address this and has failed. IBMs SWT comes closer but still hasn&#8217;t really challenged native MS technologies on the client.

    Really, what&#8217;s the problem with Java and GUIs? Microsoft has been able to build more then one good GUI framework for Windows, why can&#8217;t someone build one for Java? Of course, I understand the issue with multiple platforms but common.

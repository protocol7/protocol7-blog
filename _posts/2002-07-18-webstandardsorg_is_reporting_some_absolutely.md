  <p>
    webstandards.org is <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/buzz/archive/2002_07.html#a000062">reporting</a> some absolutely great news: Lycos Europe is moving to a new design (preview <a href="http://jscript.dk/lycos/2/">here</a>), totally based on XHTML 1.0 transitional and CSS. Way cool, this is the first large (as measured in hits) that is doing this move. Who&#8217;s next?

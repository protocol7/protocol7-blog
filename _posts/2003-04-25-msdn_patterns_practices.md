    Pretty sure that I have linked to this before, but it&#8217;s well worth a second time. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/type/Patterns/default.asp">MSDN patterns & practices</a> must be the best page on the entire MSDN. A must have for anyone who plans to write any high-quality and reusable code in .NET.

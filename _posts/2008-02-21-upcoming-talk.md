    Looks like I will be talking at ApacheCon EU in April. Originally, <a href="http://eu.apachecon.com/eu2008/program/talk/2490">Peter Royal was supposed to give a talk</a> on <a href="http://mina.apache.org/">Apache MINA</a> but had to cancel his appearance. Instead, I will try to fill his shoes. The topic is still the same, a high level overview of MINA 2.0 and a walk through on how to write a simple application using MINA. If you&#8217;ll be at ApacheCon and want to meet up for a beer or got some thoughts on what would be interesting to cover in the presentation, feel free to get <a href="mailto:niklas@protocol7.com">in touch</a>.

    This will be my first ApacheCon, a conference I&#8217;ve been wanting to visit for some years now. Happy to be going. I hope to meet some of the Apache people one has gotten to know from the community.

  <p>
    I went over to take a closer look at <a href="http://domapi.com">DomAPI</a>. They got some really impressive stuff there (look at the <a href="http://domapi.com/examples">examples</a>). It&#8217;s to bad that they have not gone with an approach that will degrade in older browsers, but that might something coming in future versions (at least for some of the widgets).

    <a href="http://marten.gustafson.pp.se/blog/2006/04/07/zystems-donates-to-open-source/">As noted by Mårten</a>, at work we have decided to give some back to the open source community. We&#8217;re quite heavy users of open source software, both for our internal systems (e.g. Ubuntu, Subversion, Apache, Tomcat, Maven) and our software (e.g. Spring, Hibernate, commons). As a way of showing our gratitude we will be donating money to projects voted by our employees a couple of times per year.

    Of course, as hopefully nice citizens we also try to contribute back improvements made on software we use, but that goes without saying :-)

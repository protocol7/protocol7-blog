  <p>
    DeveloperWorks has a <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-sxbl1/index.html?ca=drs-tp0405">new article</a> from Elliot Rusty Harold on sXBL, the SVG XML Binding Language. While I don&#8217;t agree with the SVG WG to focus on building an application framework for the web (I think there&#8217;s enough for them to do on specifying the perfect vector graphics language first) I think it&#8217;s great that XBL is finally being standardised. I don&#8217;t expect much to happen with sXBL (too SVG specific), but I think that exciting things might occur when XBL 2.0 is published. If ever implemented in browsers it will be very powerful for web developers.

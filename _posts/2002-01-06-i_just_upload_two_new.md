<div class='microid-ea159ed0bb0c60cc35fd6370b8849d3beb8dd543'>
  <p>
    I just upload two new scripts with docs. The first is a event engine that makes it possible to create your own events for any object in your scripts. The other is a persistent socket connection script for your games and chats. You find them both in the code section.

  <p>
    <a href="http://rob.crabapples.net">Rob Fahrni</a>, a guy on the Visio team, made this funky script that turns a <a href="http://www.opml.org/">OPML</a><a href="http://rob.crabapples.net/dev/prism/test/states.vdx"></a> file into a Visio drawing. Before I read about this I didn&#8217;t know about the Visio XML format, VDX. A XML format that is totally full-circle is a very good idea and opens up many possibilities. The most obvious one for me: turn it into SVG using a XSL stylesheet.

    So, <a href="http://www.protocol7.com/visiosvg/default.asp?ie=.svg">here</a> is the first attempt. It&#8217;s based on Rob&#8217;s states.vdx file and is generated on the fly. The XSL stylesheet is only 90 lines of code. I will release it as soon as I have added more functionality and cleaned it up some more.

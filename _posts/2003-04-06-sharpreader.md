    The word on <a href="http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/2003/04/06.html#000056">SharpReader</a> is spreading through the weblogging world today. I already switched Newzcrawler for it and I like it very much. So, now there&#8217;s at least four different .NET apps for aggregating RSS feeds (SharpReader, Aggie, RssBandit, Harvester). It will be very interesting to see what this &#8220;competition&#8221; will lead to.

    <a href="http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/archives/002865.shtml">Brad Wilson has some comments</a> on these new aggregators as well. I would certainly agree with him that having the possibility of using Gecko for the HTML rendering would be great. <a href="http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/">Luke</a>, can we have that? :-)

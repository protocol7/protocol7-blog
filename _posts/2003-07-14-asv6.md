    <a href="http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/beta.html">Adobe has announced a technical preview of their upcoming SVG viewer, called ASV6</a>. Lots of new things including support for almost all of SVG 1.2. It&#8217;s very exciting to see Adobe back in the game.

    I&#8217;ve been playing some with the viewer that shipped with the new Adobe reader so I&#8217;ve tried some of the new stuff, but now when it&#8217;s official I&#8217;ll try out as much as I can. Expect to see more on this soon.

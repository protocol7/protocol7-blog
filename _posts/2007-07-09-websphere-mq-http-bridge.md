    Today, we had a house call from <a href="http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=30624&lid=Rapport">the major news show</a> at the national Swedish television. They&#8217;re making a segment on <a href="http://kiva.org/">kiva.org</a> and wanted to interview us on why we choose to use it. The reporter found us from <a href="http://www.protocol7.com/archives/2007/02/18/kiva/">me</a> and <a href="http://protocol7.com/eva/?p=497">Eva blogging</a> when first starting to use the site. Luckily, I managed to almost completely escape to camera, Eva took the biggest hit.

    The topics of the questions focused on how we found Kiva and why one would choose Kiva over a more traditional poverty fighting organization. The also interviewed another guy in Stockholm, should be interesting to watch.

    <strike>Should air on the news tomorrow, it will be interesting how their story ends up and how Eva looks on TV :-). The segment should appear online, I&#8217;ll add a link when it does.</strike> Okay, it aired today and is <a href="http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?a=867738">up on the web</a>. Based on Eva&#8217;s face I really wonder what is on that screen :-)

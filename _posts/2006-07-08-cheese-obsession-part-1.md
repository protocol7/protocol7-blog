    Inspired by <a href="http://marten.gustafson.pp.se/matjournalen/">Mårtens food blog</a>, I&#8217;m going to start posting my own experiences into the fine art of eating. I guess it will be mostly about cheese and fine beer, but you never know :-)

  <p>
    So, to start of. Almost every weekend Eva and me stroll down to the cheese store on <a href="http://www.linnegatansost.se">Linnégatan</a>. This weekend was no different. Waiting for consumtion this time is:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      a <a href="http://www.chimay.com/en/chimay_with_beer_246.php">Chimay with Beer</a>, a cheese made by the Trappist monks famous for the Chimay beer. This variant is washed with that very beer, giving it a particular taste
    </li>
    <li>
      Blå get from Lillängen
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reblochon">Reblochon</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Last but not least, a beatiful piece of Ubriaco di Amarone. The Ubriaco is a hard cheese made from cow milk which is washed with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarone">Amarone</a>, a strong, tasty red wine.
    </li>
  </ul>

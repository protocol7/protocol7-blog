    Since I know that there are some food nerds around I thought I ask around for some advice on buying a new pepper grinder. The trouble with my current, which was probably fairly expensive, is that it produces way to fine-grained result. With black pepper I prefer fairly large grains. A grinder that can be adjusted for different grain sizes is even better. Money is&nbsp;(almost)&nbsp;not an issue, at least for quality stuff.

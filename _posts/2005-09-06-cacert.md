    On <a href="http://www.saint-andre.com/blog/2005-08.html#2005-08-26T19:17">Mr Jabber, Peter Saint-Andre&#8217;s blog</a>, I found a real gem, <a href="http://www.cacert.org/">CACert</a>. CACert is a community for issuing certficates for free. By using a distributed network of assures (we have two here in Gothenburg for example) I can get enough points to get a valid certificate for my identity. And, if I get further assurance points, a will be able to assure others and help spread the network.

    I&#8217;ve previsously used <a href="http://www.thawte.com/wot/">Thawte Web of Trust</a> which works in the same manner, however I do like the openess and simplicity of CACert. I&#8217;ve not been assured by the two guys here in Gothenburg and is waiting for them to enter my points. After that, I can get my personal certificate.

    The only main issue with CACert right now is that the <a href="http://www.cacert.org/index.php?id=3">CACert root certificate</a> is not included in the main products (Windows, IE, Mozilla) yet. This means that without verifying and installing the root certificate manually, people will not be able to trust my certificate.

    Steve Jobs just presented IPhoto which seemed pretty lame. A program to keep track of your photos. XPhas that built in already&#8230; ACDC has it just as good&#8230; naah&#8230;

    and the new iMac looks like a toy&#8230; don&#8217;t know why anyone would want it other then as a pretty thing in the apartment&#8230; I think Apple can do better stuff then this!

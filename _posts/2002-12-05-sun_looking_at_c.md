  <p>
    <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=201">JSR# 201</a> &#8211; Sun is looking into adding a few new constructs to Java: enumerations, autoboxing, enhanced for loop and static import. Most of which we recognize from c#. Good for the Java world and funny to see Sun playing catch-up with Microsoft :-)

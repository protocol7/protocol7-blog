    Sun <a href="http://www.sun.com/2003-0805/feature/#findoutmore" title="Mad Hatter screenshots">is showing of some screen shots of their upcoming desktop, called Mad Hatter</a>. That is one ugly skin! Come on Sun, is that really the best you can do? With <a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/longhorn_aero.asp">Aero</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/technologies/aqua.html">Aqua</a> around you smell of a mid-90&#8217;s system.

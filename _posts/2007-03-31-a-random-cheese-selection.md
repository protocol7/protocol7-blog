    Once again I&#8217;ve fallen behind on writing on the cheeses consumed lately. So, this time I&#8217;ll just choose a random selection, pretty much those I can recall. The selection is also influenced by me finding a new cheese shop that focus on cheeses made locally, that is, close to G&ouml;teborg.

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.paverasgardsmejeri.nu/brunfjall.html">Brun fj&auml;ll</a>: Made at the <a href="http://www.paverasgardsmejeri.nu/">P&aring;ver&aring;s dairy</a> in Falk&ouml;ping, this is a Morbier type cheese that has quickly become one of my favorites. The cheese is made from milk from the domastic cow, fj&auml;llko. One trick to consider is that the cheese should be kept in room temperature for a few hours before consumed, that way the taste will be optimal. As P&aring;ver&aring;s is one of the most well estblished swedish dairies you should be able to find their cheeses, at least at a well stocked swedish shop.

    <li>
      <a href="http://www.paverasgardsmejeri.nu/rosa.html">Rosa</a>: Another cheese from P&aring;ver&aring;s. This one is a reblochon type cheese. Not at good as Brun fj&auml;ll, but still pretty decent.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.venissimo.com/product_images/clochette.jpg">Clochette</a>: a bell shaped French chevre. The piece I got was very ripe and covered in some additional mold. This gave it a stronger than usual taste for a chevre, something I enjoyed. This cheese also grows on taste if allowed room temperature for a fair amount of time before eaten.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.worldsfoods.com/upload/images/large/ossau_iraty_brebis_pyrenees.jpg">Ossau-Iraty</a>: as early spring has arrived, my local cheese shop has yet again started serving their excellent cheese sandwiches. Last week one of their usual cheeses, Caprinelle where sold out so instead I had Ossau-Iraty, I cheese I&#8217;ve never tasted before. It&#8217;s made out of sheep milk in the french Pyrenees and protected under the AOC quality brand. It was served on a dark bread with fig marmelade, a perfect combination.

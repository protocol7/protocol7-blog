    Once again I&#8217;ve fallen behind on writing on the cheeses consumed lately. So, this time I&#8217;ll just choose a random selection, pretty much those I can recall. The selection is also influenced by me finding a new cheese shop that focus on cheeses made locally, that is, close to Göteborg.

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.paverasgardsmejeri.nu/brunfjall.html">Brun fjäll</a>: Made at the <a href="http://www.paverasgardsmejeri.nu/">Påverås dairy</a> in Falköping, this is a Morbier type cheese that has quickly become one of my favorites. The cheese is made from milk from the domastic cow, fjällko. One trick to consider is that the cheese should be kept in room temperature for a few hours before consumed, that way the taste will be optimal. As Påverås is one of the most well estblished swedish dairies you should be able to find their cheeses, at least at a well stocked swedish shop.

      <a href="http://www.paverasgardsmejeri.nu/rosa.html">Rosa</a>: Another cheese from Påverås. This one is a reblochon type cheese. Not at good as Brun fjäll, but still pretty decent.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.venissimo.com/product_images/clochette.jpg">Clochette</a>: a bell shaped French chèvre. The piece I got was very ripe and covered in some additional mold. This gave it a stronger than usual taste for a chèvre, something I enjoyed. This cheese also grows on taste if allowed room temperature for a fair amount of time before eaten.

      <a href="http://www.worldsfoods.com/upload/images/large/ossau_iraty_brebis_pyrenees.jpg">Ossau-Iraty</a>: as early spring has arrived, my local cheese shop has yet again started serving their excellent cheese sandwiches. Last week one of their usual cheeses, Caprinelle where sold out so instead I had Ossau-Iraty, I cheese I&#8217;ve never tasted before. It&#8217;s made out of sheep milk in the french Pyrénées and protected under the AOC quality brand. It was served on a dark bread with fig marmelade, a perfect combination.

  <p>
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xhtml2-20021211/">A new XHTML 2.0 working draft</a> has been published by W3C. The big change is that linking is removed for now until the XLink controversy is resolved. I hope they are able to make a XLink 1.1 that fits with the needs for XHTML 2.0. We don&#8217;t need more then one linking mechanism.

  <p>
    builder.com got an introduction to User Interface Process Application Block (UIPAB). You just have to love that acronym :-)

  <p>
    UIPAB is Microsoft&#8217;s take on how to build WinForms applications using the MVC pattern. Haven&#8217;t tried the actually code but you would probably be interested if you&#8217;re building advanced WinForms applications.

    Today I brought our new camera, a Canon EOS 350D, out for the first time. I got based on recommendation from <a href="http://blog.nomethod.net">Gadde</a>, my personal camera guru.

    So far I&#8217;m very happy with the experience. It takes nice pictures, is fairly light to carry around and really simple for newbies like myself. And, it doesn&#8217;t require any special drivers to sync with my computer.

    We took a short around a lake close to here, in a nature reserve Sandsjöbacka. Since Eva is two weeks from the expected birth date she&#8217;s a little bit immobile but it was nice to get outside in the beatiful autumn. <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/protocol7/tags/sandsj%C3%B6backa/">I uploaded some of the pictures on flickr</a> for the rest of you to enjoy :-)

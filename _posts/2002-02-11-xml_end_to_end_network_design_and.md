    <a href="http://afongen.com/essays/xmlcms/">XML, End-to-End Network Design, and Content Management</a>. This is pretty much what I&#8217;m thinking around right now as well. My biggest problem right now is encodings when outputtting the XML to HTML since browsers don&#8217;t really handled UTF8 that good.

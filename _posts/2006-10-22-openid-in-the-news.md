    Some exciting&nbsp;news on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID">OpenID</a> adoption the last couple of days (for me anyways). First of, <a href="http://technorati.com/weblog/2006/10/144.html">Technorati is now supporting OpenID</a> for claiming your blog with more stuff coming soon. The <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/10/19/technorati-announces-support-for-open-id/">Techcrunch article about Technorati</a> also mentions that the big players are participating in discussions on OpenID. I think it would make perfect sense for someone like Google or Yahoo do like <a href="http://pip.verisignlabs.com/">Verisign</a> and start providing OpenID identies to their already existing users.

    The Technorati page contained a link to a new <a href="http://blog.verselogic.net/projects/wordpress/wordpress-openid-plugin/">OpenID plugin for WordPress</a>. This one is way more clever than <a href="http://protocol7.com/archives/2006/08/21/openid-on-protocol7/">the one I previously used</a> and requires no theme hackery what so ever (just install and you&#8217;r done). So, I reverted my hacked theme back to square one and installed the plugin. All done and OpenID authentication is working like a charm. At least that&#8217;s what my tests show, feel free to give me feedback on any troubles or improvements!

    Last but not least, <a href="http://norman.walsh.name/2006/10/20/identity">Normal Walsh seems to like OpenID as well</a>. I&#8217;ll leave with his final words that perfectly well reflects my sentiments.

      Next time you build a web application that needs a login, consider OpenID.

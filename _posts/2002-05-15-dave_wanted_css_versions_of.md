    Dave <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/05/13#l030ac4c927349b350c1b894439f0cd9e">wanted</a> CSS versions of a page he had done, and learn some CSS. So, I thought I should show him the true powers of XHTML, SVG and CSS combined:<br /> <a href="http://www.protocol7.com/lab/scripting_slide/default.asp">My stylesheet</a><br /> <a href="http://www.protocol7.com/lab/scripting_slide/default.asp?css=daves.css">Something close to Dave&#8217;s original page</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The two pages only differs on which stylesheet that is included, the XHTML and SVG is exactly the same.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    On the page I added a small SVG image, note that it changes it&#8217;s look according to the style of the page. In fact, it uses the same stylesheet as the XHTML. I think that this truly shows the benefits of the W3C standards.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The page won&#8217;t validate on the W3C validator, for two reasons:<br /> 1. embed is not in the XHTML standard, but it&#8217;s currently the only way to include plugins safely in browsers.<br /> 2. the W3C CSS validator has not been upgraded to support SVG
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You need a SVG viewer to see this page, I would recommend the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/main.html">Adobe SVG Viewer</a>.

    <a href="http://rss.com.com/2100-1023-954561.html?type=pt&part=rss&tag=feed&subj=news">Opera has redesigned their entire HTML engine</a> (also at <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/buzz/archive/2002_08.html#a000075">WaSP</a>). This is hopefully good news, finally they will be able to provide us with a fully conformant browser.

<div class='microid-fd6be21737def14b9496b9857614bf4a2fd45dab'>
  <p>
    W3C today release the first working draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-content/">CSS3 Generated and Replaced Content Module</a>. It&#8217;s the bigger brother of ::before(content:x;). From the first read it looks pretty powerful but maybe a bit complex. Anyway, I would love to be able to use headers and footers in some future browser. Will XHTML+CSS some day make XSL-FO oblivious?

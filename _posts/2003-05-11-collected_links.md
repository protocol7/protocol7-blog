  <p>
    Lots of interesting things the last couple of days:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="http://java.sun.com/features/2003/05/bloch_qa.html">The new features of Java 1.5 are being outlined</a>. This time Java is really trying to catch up with C#. Most developers are excitied about <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/review/jsr014/">generics</a> and while I think this is probably the most important feature in 1.5, <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/jsr/tiger/enum.html">typesafe enums</a> is what I miss the most in the daily Java coding.

      Nikhil Kothari, development lead on ASP.NET got a <a href="http://www.nikhilk.net/">blog</a>. <a href="http://www.nikhilk.net/Rss.ashx?id=1">Subscribed</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/">CSS Zen garden</a> is an interesting and beautiful CSS experiment
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.tkachenko.com/cgi-bin/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=23">Next version of XmlReader will be simpler to subclass</a>. Thanks!
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://dotnetweblogs.com/rosherove/posts/6868.aspx">Roy</a> thinks <a href="http://www12.brinkster.com/ultrapico/Expresso.htm">Expresso</a> rocks. Agreed, I use it every day and it&#8217;s a great time saver.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1394.html">Lots of discussions on profiling and standardizing RSS</a>. I think this is a great idea. Tons of interesting <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx?key=2003-05-11T12:13:16Z">discussions</a> have been going on at <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/05/10/RSS-std">different</a> <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/log/2003/05/a_proposal_rss_.shtml">blogs</a>, I hope it will continue at OASIS so that we can get a good spec for RSS that everyone can use and that is not owned by any one vendor.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/potm/potm-2003-05.php">POPFile is project of the month at SourceForge</a>. I&#8217;ve been using POPFile to filter my spam the last three months. I now got 99.36% accuracy which must be pretty good :-) Now I&#8217;m stepping up to use it to sort my friendly mail according to interest and other weaker patterns. It will be very interesting to see how far POPFile can help me.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml2/">A new XHTML 2.0 working draft</a>. <a href="http://tantek.com/log/2003/05.html#L20030508t1620">Tantek got the goods</a>.
    </li>

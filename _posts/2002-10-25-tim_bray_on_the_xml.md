    <a href="http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/200210/msg01357.html">Tim Bray on the XML support in Office 11</a>. From his early tests I have to say it looks a bit disappointing. A few issues:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      The could have used XHTMLto support most of the current formating. And them added their extensions. They don&#8217;t. They instead use something very different and ridiculously verbose
    </li>
    <li>
      They could have used SVG to describe WordArt. They still use VML
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Oh well, a XML based format is better then a binary at least&#8230;

    Yesterday Macromedia realeased a <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/desdev/mx/blueprint/">Pet Market demo</a> application to demostrate what they mean with &#8220;Rich Internet Application&#8221;. The site comes in different version with support for .NET and J2EE backends. Even if I&#8217;m not sure if I like the graphical design and I don&#8217;t like Flash as a format, the idea of these kind of front ends are interesting. Hopefully, browsers will soon be stable enough to build these kind of applications easily while still using open, accessible standards such as XHTML, CSS and SVG.

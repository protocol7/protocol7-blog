    The wonderful full screen editor <a href="http://they.misled.us/dark-room/">Dark Room</a> as just gotten slightly better. <a href="http://they.misled.us/archives/587">Version 0.8b</a> is out with nice looking highlightning. If you&#8217;r like me and get really easily distracted while trying to write prose (I can focus when writing code), you should probably try out Dark Room or one of it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/product/writeroom">similar</a> <a href="http://www.codealchemists.com/jdarkroom/">friends</a>.

    <a href="http://taint.org/2007/06/19/121541a.html">This has got to be one of the cutest tricks I&#8217;ve seen</a>. A few years ago I wrote a simple Flash script that solved any similar (two openings on the outer wall) maze using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%2A">an A* algorithm</a>, probably got it laying around somewhere. Doing it in Gimp beats it tough.

  <p>
    <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla0.9.8/">Mozilla 0.9.8</a> has been released. They don&#8217;t really mention any HTML, DOM or CSS bugs that are fixed but I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ve fixed a bunch. But what I&#8217;m not at all happy about are these two things:<br /> * some HTTP posts will fail. I have to check if this is true for Flash or Adobe SVG Viewer. If it is it a serious problem<br /> * the DHTML performance is even worse then before. I&#8217;m amazed that it was even possible to get it slower. Please, dear Mozilla programmers, look into this since it currently makes it impossible to create anything that uses timeouts (such as animations).

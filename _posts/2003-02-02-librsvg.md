  <p>
    <a href="http://librsvg.sourceforge.net/">librsvg</a> is a SVG renderer written in ansi C for GNOME. The screenshots looks pretty good, and they even claim to have a renderer that is faster then the bitmap renderers. If that is still true when more of the SVG spec is implemented then librsvg would be really useful for lots of applications.

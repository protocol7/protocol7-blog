    Damien Katz is <a href="http://damienkatz.net/2008/01/new_gig.html">going to IBM</a> to work full time on <a href="http://www.couchdb.org">CouchDB</a>. All arranged by <a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/">Sam Ruby</a> and friends. This is excellent news for the CouchDB community. Besides having Damien being focused on the project, getting IBMs deep knowledge on storage systems, both from DB2 and Domino/Notes I&#8217;m sure will be very beneficial.

    And on top of all that, the code is moving to Apache and will be relicensed under ASL2. Still <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/200801.mbox/browser">no open discussions</a> in <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">Apache Incubator</a>, but I&#8217;m guessing that&#8217;s where it&#8217;s heading. Having CouchDB at Apache will be great! And I like that Apache is getting into more alternative technologies besides the comfort zone of C and Java.

    CouchDB is getting more and more interesting to watch by the day.

    <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/public/protocol7">One of my favorite blogs</a> has to be Michel Kay&#8217;s <a href="http://saxonica.blogharbor.com/blog">Saxon diaries</a>. If you&#8217;re not already familiar with Michael Kay, he&#8217;s one of the, if not the, foremost expert of XSL-T and related technologies. And he&#8217;s the sole creator behind <a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/">Saxon</a>, the best XSL-T engine around.

    His posts usually deals with various improvements, mostly performance related, to Saxon. And they deal in very great detail. More than you will ever need, but still it tells you a lot about how to improve on a stable code base. The <a href="http://saxonica.blogharbor.com/blog/_archives/2007/8/25/3183053.html">two most</a> <a href="http://saxonica.blogharbor.com/blog/_archives/2007/9/25/3252121.html">recent posts</a> are excellent examples.

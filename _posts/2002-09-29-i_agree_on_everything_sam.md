  <p>
    I agree on everything Sam Ruby says <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/2002/09/28.html#a859">about namespaces and RSS 2.0</a>. And isn&#8217;t it just a bit bold to call it RSS 2.0. It&#8217;s basically a big pile of elements added, trying to do what RSS 1.0 already can do with modules. In a less structured fashion. I just don&#8217;t understand it.

    One small bump that someone had modified slightly since my last visit, and this is the result. <a rel="lightbox" href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/213/506495725_d5e3303f50_b.jpg"><img style="margin: 5px; float: right" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/213/506495725_d5e3303f50_m.jpg" /></a>The knee isn&#8217;t looking very good either, but the picture of it doesn&#8217;t really make it justice.

    In addition, it&#8217;s great planning to perform a dive the day before I&#8217;m taking Albin to day care for the first time :-)

    Anyways, Copenhagen was great. Expect a more detailed report soon.

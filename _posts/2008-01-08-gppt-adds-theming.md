    A while back, <a href="http://protocol7.com/archives/2007/09/18/gdocs-presentations-theming/">I complained</a> on Google Docs new Powerpoint-wannabe not having any support for creating a custom theme. Seems like they quite promptly fixed that. Goodie. Now I just need to find a reason to do a presentation.

  <p>
    Sun has <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-857513.html">announced</a> that they will release two hardware solutions for the Liberty Allience. They (and some analysts) claim that this will be a big step for Sun into the world of web services security. I would say that until Liberty shows of any spec of what they want to do.

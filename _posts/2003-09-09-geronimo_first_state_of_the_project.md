    <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=11423">Geronimo, the Apache J2EE project has released it&#8217;s first state of the project address</a>. Judging from the report and the activity and quality on the <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/SummarizeList?listId=140">mailing list</a> it looks really promising. <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/home/thread.jsp?thread_id=21311#94927">Rickard &Ouml;berg seems</a> to think so too.

    Yesterday Eva ended all our chances of a normal life. Back home from lunch she brought a copy ofâ€¦ World of Warcraft. I knew that if we fell for the temptation we would get pulled in and stuck. And we already are. If you find a level 5 human out there called NiklasPSeven, come by and say Hi, it&#8217;s probably just me ignoring a hungry Albin crying somewhere nearby.

  <p>
    The last couple of days I&#8217;ve been trying out the brand new <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/index.asp">Topstyle 3</a> from Nick Bradbury, the creator of Homesite.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you want to write (X)HTML and CSS in a good way and conform to standards and accessability guideline, and you should, Topstyle is the best editor I&#8217;ve seen. By far. Topstyle got a superior editor, great CSS help, Tidy built-in, perfect integration with the great <a href="http://www.htmlvalidator.com/cseandtopstyle.php">CSE HTML Validator</a> and much more. And it only costs $79.95 and comes with newgroup-based support from Nick himself. It&#8217;s an amazing program, go buy it right away and never write crappy HTML/CSS again.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    And while you&#8217;r at it, use the built-in HTML to XHTML converter and be a really good developer.

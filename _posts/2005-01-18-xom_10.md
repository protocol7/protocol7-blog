    Elliotte Rusty Harold, a few days ago, <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/#news2005January6">released 1.0</a> of his XML object model, <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM/">XOM</a> after a fairly well extended beta period. I&#8217;ve been using the late beta versions in a few project of mine and must say that I&#8217;m very impressed with his work. It simple and straightforward to use (yes, all of you using the empty Transformer to serialize your JAXP Document, I&#8217;m talking to you) and produces very consistent results.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As someone that has allways been very annoyed by the lack of interfaces and surplus of implementation classes in the .NET System.Xml library, I find myself a bit surprised by how much I like his <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM/designprinciples.xhtml#d0e224">design principle of focusing on classes</a>. To create an Element you simply do:<br /> <code>&lt;br />
Element myElm = new Element("myLocalName", "http://mynamespace.org");&lt;br />
</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    No more passing around a Document just to create all the object you need. But, at the same Elliote doesn&#8217;t entirely lock you into his classes, you&#8217;re free to subclass them (in a controlled manner, not to let you construct non-wellformed XML documents) and create your own NodeFactory for creating them during parsing.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    All in all I can strongly recommend you taking a look at XOM, for some of your applications I think it will significantly simplify your work. And, there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/XOM/samples.xhtml">quite a few samples</a> to get you going.

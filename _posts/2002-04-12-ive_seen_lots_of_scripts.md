  <p>
    I&#8217;ve seen lots of scripts trying to turn JavaScript into a full OO language. <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsclass">JSClass</a> is way ahead of the others. Use it and get support for any OO techique you ever wanted (except for operator overloading), and it doesn&#8217;t use a too clumpsy syntax.

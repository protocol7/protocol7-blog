    Great feedback on the <a href="http://protocol7.com/archives/2006/11/06/pepper-grinder/">pepper grinder post</a>. Several commenters suggested the Peugot grinders, something I had already been looking at myself. So, I went out and got me one. It wasn&#8217;t cheap, but damn it grinds well. Six levels of grain size, nice heavy feel and 25 years or warranty. Can&#8217;t go wrong with that.

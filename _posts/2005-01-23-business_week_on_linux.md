    Business Week has a lengthy article on Linux, described from the standpoint of being a somewhat unusual &#8220;corporation&#8221;. Its an interesting read and shows how great the industry move behind Linux really is.

    Early last year I made a promise to switch to Linux on my laptop before the end of the year, unfortunately this did turn out true as some of the tools I use daily at work, most notably some editions of WSAD, does not work on Linux. However, this looks like it will change soon so I&#8217;ll extends my promise to the end of 2005. Before then I will run Linux on my laptop as well as on my other personal computers (this is already done). The reason? I simply like the platform better, the command line interface that can do anything (no more RDP), apt-get/yum installations and the openness are the main driving factors.

    The SharpVectorGraphics project, which is hacking on a SVG viewer for .NET, will make it&#8217;s first public release (version 0.2) in a few days. So far, <a href="http://www.protocol7.com/svg.net/tests.asp">we pass 49 of the test cases</a> in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Test">SVG 1.0 Test Suite</a> (we passed 20 with version 0.1). That&#8217;s really good progress if you ask me :-)

    More news as soon as we release the files.

Of course, I guess everyone already know this but if you have anything remotely to do with Scrum, you should make sure you read this book as soon as possible. It&#8217;s shock full of great, practical tips on how you best work within the bounds of Scrum. In fact, given how thin it is, it probably has the highest density of knowledge I have ever come across in a book. Well worth the four hours or so it takes to read.

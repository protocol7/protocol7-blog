  <p>
    On of my former colleagues, Martin Rydman, has <a href="http://mrbaseline.wordpress.com/">started blogging</a>. In one of his first posts, he takes a look at Jim Webber&#8217;s <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/webber-guerilla-soa">debunking of ESBs</a>. Martin is a really clever guy and responsible for the Baseline concept (or should that be &#8220;methodology&#8221;?) so his blog will be interesting to follow. But the most interesting trend here is that Zystems <a href="http://marten.gustafson.pp.se/blog/2008/02/06/mr-baseline-got-himself-a-blog/">wants to be more open</a> and active in the community. I most certainly applaud that. Let&#8217;s get the discussions flowing.

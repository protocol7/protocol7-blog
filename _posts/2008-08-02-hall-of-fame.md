    Woot! The epic battle between OSGi and JSR277 seems to have taken yet another turn. Sun has <a href="http://markmail.org/message/pokdlphe3c6p53wj">hired Richard S Hall</a>, of <a href="http://felix.apache.org/site/index.html">Apache Felix</a> fame. Possibly one of the very foremost experts on OSGi. His task is to work on OSGi for Glassfish. To me, this is interesting both in terms of JSR277 and what deeper OSGi support in Glassfish would mean. Is Sun looking at doing native bundle deployment to Glassfish, ala <a href="http://www.springsource.com/products/suite/applicationplatform">SpringSource Application Platform</a> and <a href="http://www.paremus.com/products/products.html">Infiniflow</a>? If so, it would be another major step towards a decent module model for Java EE applications. And, as a bonus it might do some good for the historically cold relation between Apache and Sun.

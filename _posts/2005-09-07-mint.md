    I immediatelly fell for the pressure and bought <a href="http://www.haveamint.com">Mint</a>, the hyped site statistics app from <a href="http://www.shauninman.com/plete/">Shaun Inman</a>. Bought (via PayPal), downloaded and installed, all within five minutes. So far I&#8217;ve only used it for an hour so it&#8217;s way to early to tell how it will work out but here are some intial reflections.

    The AJAX based GUI is very slick. I would like to be able to provide links to the individual portlets.

    Pepper, the plugin interface is easy to use. I installed the UserAgent 007 plugin in less than a minute and it instantly started collecting data.

    Now, its going to be interesting to see if a plugin community evolves around Mint.

  <p>
    <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.java.geronimo.devel/10574">From the Geronimo mailing list</a>, Atlassian has developed a <a href="http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAEXT/JIRA+Subversion+plugin">Subversion plugin for JIRA</a>. Since we&#8217;re heavy JIRA users at work, this might be very interesting if we decide to make the move to SVN.

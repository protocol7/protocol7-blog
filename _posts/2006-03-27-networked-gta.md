    <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/2006/03/24/news_6146578.html">Rumour</a> has it that a future Grand Theft Auto might be in the form of a multiplayer game. Just yesterday I finished all the main missions of GTA3 San Andreas (some 77% completion over all). Networked or not, I can&#8217;t wait to get my hands on the next sequel. GTA3 SA was by far the best game I&#8217;ve ever played. And with 100+ main missions, 100+ races and tons of other optional missions, it&#8217;s hard to get more bang for the bucks.

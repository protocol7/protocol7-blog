      &#8220;I Blame Microsoft (I?ve always wanted to use that as a headline. Try it sometime, it feels good.) But really, I do. The problem isn?t that CSS is too hard. The problem isn?t browser incompatibilities in general. The problem is specifically that Microsoft Internet Explorer is a mouldering, out-of-date, amateurish, out-of-date pile of dung. Did I say it?s out-of-date? As in past its sell-by, seen better days, mutton dressed as lamb, superannuated, time-worn. It?s so, like, you know, so twentieth-century.&#8221;

    Someone else (can&#8217;t remember who, <a href="mailto:niklas@protocol7.com">remind me if you know</a>) wrote some time ago: &#8220;IE, the new Netscape 4&#8221;. That&#8217;s almost as fun.

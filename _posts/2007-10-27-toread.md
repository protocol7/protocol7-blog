    <a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.services.soa.yahoo-1/6177">Pete Lacey started a thread</a> on peoples favorite reading material over at the service-orientated-architecture mailing list. Quite a few people has chimed in and the list is getting pretty extensive. <a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.services.soa.yahoo-1/6226">Mike Glendinning&#8217;s list</a> is in itself impressive. Anyways, I collected the suggested books into an <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/KY3718NDSPUV">Amazon wish list</a> for easy consumption. Enjoy.

    (Having a slow evening by myself, watching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_%28TV_series%29">Heroes</a>, eating a nice piece of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecorino_Crotonese">pecorino</a> and drinking a bottle of <a href="http://www.brakspear-beers.co.uk/brakspear2006_draught.htm">Oxford Gold</a>. Could be worse.)

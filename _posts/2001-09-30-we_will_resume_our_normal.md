    &#8220;We will resume our normal lives, but the fear will not go away. The airliner as bomb, the bomb in the stadium, the sarin gas in the subway: These are the prospects that will haunt us. Such thoughts will be paranoid, of course, and somewhat self-indulgent. Obviously most people will live out their lives with no more contact with terrorism than the horrific images they see on their television sets. But it will be enough.&#8221; &#8211; David Rieff, <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2001/09/25/modernity/index.html?x">There is no alternative to war</a>

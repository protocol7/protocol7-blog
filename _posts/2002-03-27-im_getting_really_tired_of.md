    I&#8217;m getting really tired of Sun&#8217;s, nowadays pretty mono-directional, <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-868943.html?tag=prntfr">war</a> with Microsoft. Why don&#8217;t they start promoting J2EE on its own merits instead of backing at .Net all the time. Don&#8217;t they belive in J2EE&#8217;s powers anymore?

    Mark Pilgrim has been having a lot of fun <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/12/27.html#pushing_the_envelope">using the cite element in HTML</a> to automatically produce a <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/citations/">citation index for his blog</a> (he also <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/12/29.html">posted a follow up with some comments</a>). Pretty clever as usual. And, as we&#8217;re all used to by now this of couse started a huge discussion on sementics and HTML.

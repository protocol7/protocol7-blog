    Woho! Corel releases a preview of their own <a href="http://www3.corel.com/cgi-bin/gx.cgi/AppLogic FTContentServer?pagename=Corel/Product/SmartGraphics/SVGViewer">SVG viewer</a>. So far there much missing but this is only the preview. Corel are know for high-quality products so I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll see great SVG support from them very soon. Also, they announced a SVG based graphics tool for the Microsoft Tablet PC and info on their new concept, Smart Graphics. All of this is very exciting for people like me that wants more open and easier-to-work-with graphics formats. Way to go Corel!

  <p>
    We had an old printer stuffed away on the store. It connects via the parallell port and Evas laptop doesn&#8217;t have one. So, we&#8217;ve been printing through my laptop which only happens to be available when I&#8217;m home. So, I wanted to hook the printer up to the Ubuntu box we have for storing files and serving up some other stuff (like subversion). I started reading through some articles on how to configure Samba to do this. But it required a fair amount of hackery. Then, I found this <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NetworkPrintingFromWinXP">wonderful howto describing how to set it up using only CUPS</a>. Took something like 3 minutes and works like a charm. Dead simple.

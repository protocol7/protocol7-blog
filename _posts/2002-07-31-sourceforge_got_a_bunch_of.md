  <p>
    SourceForge got a bunch of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=10472&group_id=1">build servers</a>, many donated from companies such as Compaq and Apple. How about Microsoft donating a server for C# compilation? Wouldn&#8217;t cost a lot of money and would offer great support for the open-source comminity.

    The SVG viewer, written in C#, that I&#8217;m working on is slowly getting there. It now supports:<br /> Viewports (almost)<br /> Transformations<br /> Almost all path commands<br /> All primitives<br /> Groups<br /> and a few other things as well.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The basic system design is now done, adding new things is really fast.

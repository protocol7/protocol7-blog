    One of my few personal heros, Stephen Jay Gould <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news_article.jhtml?type=search&StoryID=985184">died</a> of cancer today aged 60. Gould is most famous for his books, such as &#8220;The Panda&#8217;s Thumb&#8221; (I&#8217;ve read it probably five times) but I got most from reading his many scientific articles.<br /> This is a sad day.

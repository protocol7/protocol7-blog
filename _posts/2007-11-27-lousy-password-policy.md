    Today I received an account for checking my account status for a credit card. On first login I had to change to generated password they sent me to something of my own choice. However, their password policy seems a bit awkward to me. Translated from Swedish:<br /> 
    
    <blockquote>
      The new password must consist of at least 6 characters (a-z and 0-9) and may not have more than two of the same characters in a row. The password must contain at least one digit, but no more than three digits in a row. It must be no longer than 44 characters.</p>
    </blockquote>

      Having these onerous rules leads to two things, both reducing security: 
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          None of my usual passwords match the rules (usually due to containing characters not oncluded in a-z and 0-9. That means I have to write down this password to have a chance of remembering it. In my case that means <a href="http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/">PasswordSafe</a>, but for most people I suspecting it might mean a sticky note, <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/06/write_down_your.html">and probably not in their wallet</a>.
        </li>
        <p>
          <li>
            The rules actually reduce the number of possible passwords, leading to easier brute force attacks.
          </li>
          <p>
            </ul>

              I don&#8217;t really understand the motivation behind them. If they has at least inhibited the <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/12/realworld_passw.html">common passwords people use</a>, but no.

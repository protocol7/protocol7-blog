    A new project, <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/SynapseProposal">Synapse</a>, has been proposed for Apache incubation. The project aims to build an ESB/broker that will complement the Apache WS stack. The main initiators of the proposal are some of the Apache WS heavyweights like <a href="http://blogs.cocoondev.org/dims/archives/003328.html">Dims</a>. While I still need some convincing of whether &#8220;the principles of service oriented architectures&#8221; is the final solution to integration, the proposal is interesting. If the project is successful (and I have no doubts it will) it will be a strong contender in the quickly evolving ESB/BPM/JBI space. It sure will be interesting to see how it will stand up against the giants, primarily <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/info1/websphere/index.jsp?tab=products/businessint">IBM&#8217;s WBI</a> and <a href="http://www.bea.com/framework.jsp?CNT=index.htm&#038;FP=/content/products/aqualogic/">BEA&#8217;s AquaLogic</a>. History has shown that open-source software can be very successful in the middleware space. Since that has made app servers commondity, this area has lately attracted a lot of interest from the vendors as a way of building added value on their existing infrastructure. One can not help but wondering how long that will last.

    I must say that I&#8217;m a but surprised that the <a href="http://servicemix.org/">ServiceMix</a> people doesn&#8217;t seem to be involved in this. It does seem to fit them like a glove, maybe some more people-level integration is needed?

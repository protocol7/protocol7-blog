  <p>
    I just uploaded a first <a href="http://www.protocol7.com/default.asp?x=projdoc/p7_xmlrpc_svg">example</a> of the code documentation we will be using here on protocol7. It uses this <a href="http://www.protocol7.com/default.asp?x=projdoc/p7_xmlrpc_svg&a=xml">XML source</a> (a slightly modified version of the youngpup format). Currently I&#8217;ve only made XSL stylesheets for javascript objects but other types of components will be coming as well (services, CSS and maybe more). All code will be made freely available soon :-)

  <p>
    After a long time, <a href="http://commons.apache.org/net/">commons-net 2.0</a> has <a href="http://markmail.org/message/suic73mskg6agn7m">finally been released</a>. It is now also available in the <a href="http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/commons-net/commons-net/2.0/">central Maven repo</a>. While there are many changes and general clean ups in the release, the big news for me is the support for FTPS. That&#8217;s a feature we use a lot in the unit testing of <a href="http://mina.apache.org/ftpserver/">Apache FtpServer</a> so now having commons-net release rather than as a snapshot should make life easier.<br /> Now, countdown to getting <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FTPSERVER/fixforversion/12313395">1.0-M4</a> of FtpServer released has started. Still got some bugs to fix.

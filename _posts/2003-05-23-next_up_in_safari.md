    <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/archives/2003_05.html#003340">David Hyatt is taking votes on the next standard to implement in Safari</a>. The battle seems to be between XSLT, SVG and CSS3.

    I think all of these are important but from my personal preferences I mostly do XSLT on the server and CSS3 is not yet ready. So, I would say that Apple should go for SVG. With the outstanding rendering with Quartz and the possibility to mix XHTML and SVG we should see some amazing new development in the web area. Safari would also be in the lead among all the major browsers by fully embrazing SVG in the core engine. Hopefully Mozilla will follow when/if the SVG stuff gets moved into the main branch. IE? Will we ever see a new version? <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0117167/2003/05/17.html#a305">Rumour has it that more developers work on MS Works then on IE</a>.

    <a href="http://koala.ilog.fr/batik/mlists/batik-dev/archives/msg03534.html">Batik 1.5 is finally ready</a>. Batik now comes with full scripting support and continues to be the best viewer around. But development to finalize it and support animation seems to have halted due to lack of time. That&#8217;s really too bad, I hope more developers will step in and we&#8217;ll see a Batik 2.0 in the not to far future.

    <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=34870">Eclipse 3.1 has been released.</a> Eclipse servers are probably smoking by now, the site is hardly accessable (BitTorrent anyone?).

    I&#8217;ve been using every milestone since 3.0 and very much like what I&#8217;ve seen in 3.1. Since I don&#8217;t use J2S&#8230; sorry Java Platform SE 5.0 yet, I don&#8217;t care much about generics and friends. I do like the small things, like performance improvments, quick-filtering of the tree in Preferences, and the new CVS commit dialog.

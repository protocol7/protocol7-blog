    Yes, I agree that the <a href="http://cbc.ca/sports/afp/wc-flash/2/gametracker.html">World Cup Game Tracker</a> is <a href="http://weblog.delacour.net/archives/2002/06/09.html#e000514">useful</a>. But, what&#8217;s the value of having the application in a format that is hard to index and not accessiable when it could just as well been done with something as simple as HTML? I like Flash, but I think it should be used with caution and only where it&#8217;s really needed.

    Corel today <a href="http://www3.corel.com/cgi-bin/gx.cgi/AppLogic FTContentServer?pagename=Corel/Product/SmartGraphics/SVGViewer">released the second prelease of their SVG viewer</a>. New features include better scripting support, radial gradients, more text features and even a few filters. Cool!

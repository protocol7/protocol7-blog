    <a href="http://www.deftone.com/blogzilla/archives/mozilla_getting_faster.html">Link pre-feching</a>, now added to Mozilla, allowes page authors to specify stuff that the browser should download to it&#8217;s cache before even going there. This will be very powerful for speeding up sites. And allows us to do something done with crappy hacks (hidden frames, scripts) in a much better way. Way to go Mozilla (again)!

  <p>
    After a series of post, <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/mr/entry/jigsaw">Mark Reinhold today announced</a> that not only is Sun halting the failed JSR-277, but also that it will work on modularizing the Sun JDK based on OSGi. This, from my point of view, might be one of the biggest and best improvements to the JDK in a long time. Granted it&#8217;s only the Sun JDK, I don&#8217;t think any of the other JDK vendors will object. But, having one, and only one, module system for Java, and one that is stable and battle proven, will greatly improve the Java deployment story. Finally.
